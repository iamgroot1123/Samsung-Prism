{"0": "1 Introduction\n   There are many applications of the Internet that require the creation\n   and management of a session, where a session is considered an\n   exchange of data between an association of participants. The\n   implementation of these applications is complicated by the practices\n   of participants: users may move between endpoints, they may be\n   addressable by multiple names, and they may communicate in several\n   different media - sometimes simultaneously. Numerous protocols have\n   been authored that carry various forms of real-time multimedia\n   session data such as voice, video, or text messages. The Session\n   Initiation Protocol (SIP) works in concert with these protocols by    enabling Internet endpoints (called user agents) to discover one\n   another and to agree on a characterization of a session they would\n   like to share.", "1": "Bob\u2019s\n      softphone                                        SIP Phone\n         |                |                |                |\n         |    INVITE F1   |                |                |\n         |--------------->|    INVITE F2   |                |\n         |  100 Trying F3 |--------------->|    INVITE F4   |\n         |<---------------|  100 Trying F5 |--------------->|\n         |                |<-------------- | 180 Ringing F6 |\n         |                | 180 Ringing F7 |<---------------|\n         | 180 Ringing F8 |<---------------|     200 OK F9  |\n         |<---------------|    200 OK F10  |<---------------|\n         |    200 OK F11  |<---------------|                |\n         |<---------------|                |                |\n         |                       ACK F12                    |\n         |------------------------------------------------->|\n         |                   Media Session                  |\n         |<================================================>|\n         |                       BYE F13                    |\n         |<-------------------------------------------------|\n         |                     200 OK F14                   |\n         |------------------------------------------------->|\n         |                                                  |\n         Figure 1: SIP session setup example with SIP trapezoid\n      INVITE sip:bob@biloxi.com SIP/2.0\n      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds\n      Max-Forwards: 70\n      To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>\n      From: Alice <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;tag=1928301774\n      Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710@pc33.atlanta.com\n      CSeq: 314159 INVITE\n      Contact: <sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com>\n      Content-Type: application/sdp\n      Content-Length: 142\n      (Alice\u2019s SDP not shown)\n   The first line of the text-encoded message contains the method name\n   (INVITE).", "2": "If a UAS does not understand an option-tag listed in a\n   Require header field, it MUST respond by generating a response with\n   status code 420 (Bad Extension).

In\n   rare circumstances, where the server cannot process the request\n   without the extension, the server MAY send a 421 (Extension Required)\n   response. This response indicates that the proper response cannot be\n   generated without support of a specific extension.

Section 10 covers the\n   REGISTER request, Section 11 covers the OPTIONS request, Section 13\n   covers the INVITE request, and Section 15 covers the BYE request. 8.2.6 Generating the Response\n   When a UAS wishes to construct a response to a request, it follows\n   the general procedures detailed in the following subsections.

Rather, UASs SHOULD generate a final response to\n   a non-INVITE request as soon as possible. When a 100 (Trying) response is generated, any Timestamp header field\n   present in the request MUST be copied into this 100 (Trying)\n   response. If there is a delay in generating the response, the UAS\n   SHOULD add a delay value into the Timestamp value in the response. This value MUST contain the difference between the time of sending of\n   the response and receipt of the request, measured in seconds. 8.2.6.2 Headers and Tags\n   The From field of the response MUST equal the From header field of\n   the request.", "8": "The Call-ID header field of the response MUST equal the\n   Call-ID header field of the request.

However, if the To\n   header field in the request did not contain a tag, the URI in the To\n   header field in the response MUST equal the URI in the To header\n   field; additionally, the UAS MUST add a tag to the To header field in\n   the response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in\n   which a tag MAY be present). This serves to identify the UAS that is\n   responding, possibly resulting in a component of a dialog ID.

It replies to requests normally, but discards any state that would\n   ordinarily be retained by a UAS after a response has been sent. If a\n   stateless UAS receives a retransmission of a request, it regenerates\n   the response and resends it, just as if it were replying to the first\n   instance of the request. A UAS cannot be stateless unless the request\n   processing for that method would always result in the same response\n   if the requests are identical. This rules out stateless registrars,\n   for example. Stateless UASs do not use a transaction layer; they\n   receive requests directly from the transport layer and send responses\n   directly to the transport layer. The stateless UAS role is needed primarily to handle unauthenticated\n   requests for which a challenge response is issued.", "10": "If\n   unauthenticated requests were handled statefully, then malicious\n   floods of unauthenticated requests could create massive amounts of    transaction state that might slow or completely halt call processing\n   in a UAS, effectively creating a denial of service condition; for\n   more information see Section 26.1.5. The most important behaviors of a stateless UAS are the following:\n      o  A stateless UAS MUST NOT send provisional (1xx) responses. o  A stateless UAS MUST NOT retransmit responses. o  A stateless UAS MUST ignore ACK requests. o  A stateless UAS MUST ignore CANCEL requests. o  To header tags MUST be generated for responses in a stateless\n         manner - in a manner that will generate the same tag for the\n         same request consistently. For information on tag construction\n         see Section 19.3. In all other respects, a stateless UAS behaves in the same manner as\n   a stateful UAS. A UAS can operate in either a stateful or stateless\n   mode for each new request.", "11": "8.3 Redirect Servers\n   In some architectures it may be desirable to reduce the processing\n   load on proxy servers that are responsible for routing requests, and\n   improve signaling path robustness, by relying on redirection. Redirection allows servers to push routing information for a request\n   back in a response to the client, thereby taking themselves out of\n   the loop of further messaging for this transaction while still aiding\n   in locating the target of the request. When the originator of the\n   request receives the redirection, it will send a new request based on\n   the URI(s) it has received. By propagating URIs from the core of the\n   network to its edges, redirection allows for considerable network\n   scalability. A redirect server is logically constituted of a server transaction\n   layer and a transaction user that has access to a location service of\n   some kind (see Section 10 for more on registrars and location\n   services).", "12": "The lines that follow are a list of header fields. This\n   example contains a minimum required set.

It also contains a\n   branch parameter that identifies this transaction. To contains a display name (Bob) and a SIP or SIPS URI\n   (sip:bob@biloxi.com) towards which the request was originally\n   directed. Display names are described in RFC 2822 [3]. From also contains a display name (Alice) and a SIP or SIPS URI\n   (sip:alice@atlanta.com) that indicate the originator of the request. This header field also has a tag parameter containing a random string\n   (1928301774) that was added to the URI by the softphone. It is used\n   for identification purposes. Call-ID contains a globally unique identifier for this call,\n   generated by the combination of a random string and the softphone\u2019s\n   host name or IP address.", "13": "This location service is effectively a database\n   containing mappings between a single URI and a set of one or more\n   alternative locations at which the target of that URI can be found. A redirect server does not issue any SIP requests of its own. After\n   receiving a request other than CANCEL, the server either refuses the\n   request or gathers the list of alternative locations from the    location service and returns a final response of class 3xx. For\n   well-formed CANCEL requests, it SHOULD return a 2xx response. This\n   response ends the SIP transaction. The redirect server maintains\n   transaction state for an entire SIP transaction. It is the\n   responsibility of clients to detect forwarding loops between redirect\n   servers. When a redirect server returns a 3xx response to a request, it\n   populates the list of (one or more) alternative locations into the\n   Contact header field.", "14": "An \"expires\" parameter to the Contact header\n   field values may also be supplied to indicate the lifetime of the\n   Contact data. The Contact header field contains URIs giving the new locations or\n   user names to try, or may simply specify additional transport\n   parameters. A 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved Temporarily)\n   response may also give the same location and username that was\n   targeted by the initial request but specify additional transport\n   parameters such as a different server or multicast address to try, or\n   a change of SIP transport from UDP to TCP or vice versa. However, redirect servers MUST NOT redirect a request to a URI equal\n   to the one in the Request-URI; instead, provided that the URI does\n   not point to itself, the server MAY proxy the request to the\n   destination URI, or MAY reject it with a 404. If a client is using an outbound proxy, and that proxy actually\n      redirects requests, a potential arises for infinite redirection\n      loops.", "15": "Note that a Contact header field value MAY also refer to a different\n   resource than the one originally called. For example, a SIP call\n   connected to PSTN gateway may need to deliver a special informational\n   announcement such as \"The number you have dialed has been changed.\" A Contact response header field can contain any suitable URI\n   indicating where the called party can be reached, not limited to SIP\n   URIs. For example, it could contain URIs for phones, fax, or irc (if\n   they were defined) or a mailto:  (RFC 2368 [32]) URL. Section 26.4.4\n   discusses implications and limitations of redirecting a SIPS URI to a\n   non-SIPS URI. The \"expires\" parameter of a Contact header field value indicates how\n   long the URI is valid. The value of the parameter is a number\n   indicating seconds. If this parameter is not provided, the value of\n   the Expires header field determines how long the URI is valid. Malformed values SHOULD be treated as equivalent to 3600.", "16": "This provides a modest level of backwards compatibility with RFC\n      2543, which allowed absolute times in this header field. If an\n      absolute time is received, it will be treated as malformed, and\n      then default to 3600. Redirect servers MUST ignore features that are not understood\n   (including unrecognized header fields, any unknown option tags in\n   Require, or even method names) and proceed with the redirection of\n   the request in question. 9 Canceling a Request\n   The previous section has discussed general UA behavior for generating\n   requests and processing responses for requests of all methods. In\n   this section, we discuss a general purpose method, called CANCEL. The CANCEL request, as the name implies, is used to cancel a previous\n   request sent by a client. Specifically, it asks the UAS to cease\n   processing the request and to generate an error response to that\n   request. CANCEL has no effect on a request to which a UAS has\n   already given a final response.", "17": "Because of this, it is most useful\n   to CANCEL requests to which it can take a server long time to\n   respond. For this reason, CANCEL is best for INVITE requests, which\n   can take a long time to generate a response. In that usage, a UAS\n   that receives a CANCEL request for an INVITE, but has not yet sent a\n   final response, would \"stop ringing\", and then respond to the INVITE\n   with a specific error response (a 487). CANCEL requests can be constructed and sent by both proxies and user\n   agent clients. Section 15 discusses under what conditions a UAC\n   would CANCEL an INVITE request, and Section 16.10 discusses proxy\n   usage of CANCEL. A stateful proxy responds to a CANCEL, rather than simply forwarding\n   a response it would receive from a downstream element. For that\n   reason, CANCEL is referred to as a \"hop-by-hop\" request, since it is\n   responded to at each stateful proxy hop. 9.1 Client Behavior\n   A CANCEL request SHOULD NOT be sent to cancel a request other than\n   INVITE.", "18": "Since requests other than INVITE are responded to immediately,\n      sending a CANCEL for a non-INVITE request would always create a\n      race condition. The following procedures are used to construct a CANCEL request. The\n   Request-URI, Call-ID, To, the numeric part of CSeq, and From header\n   fields in the CANCEL request MUST be identical to those in the\n   request being cancelled, including tags. A CANCEL constructed by a\n   client MUST have only a single Via header field value matching the\n   top Via value in the request being cancelled. Using the same values\n   for these header fields allows the CANCEL to be matched with the\n   request it cancels (Section 9.2 indicates how such matching occurs). However, the method part of the CSeq header field MUST have a value\n   of CANCEL. This allows it to be identified and processed as a\n   transaction in its own right (See Section 17).", "19": "If the request being cancelled contains a Route header field, the\n   CANCEL request MUST include that Route header field\u2019s values. This is needed so that stateless proxies are able to route CANCEL\n      requests properly. The CANCEL request MUST NOT contain any Require or Proxy-Require\n   header fields. Once the CANCEL is constructed, the client SHOULD check whether it\n   has received any response (provisional or final) for the request\n   being cancelled (herein referred to as the \"original request\"). If no provisional response has been received, the CANCEL request MUST\n   NOT be sent; rather, the client MUST wait for the arrival of a\n   provisional response before sending the request. If the original\n   request has generated a final response, the CANCEL SHOULD NOT be\n   sent, as it is an effective no-op, since CANCEL has no effect on\n   requests that have already generated a final response.", "20": "When the\n   client decides to send the CANCEL, it creates a client transaction\n   for the CANCEL and passes it the CANCEL request along with the\n   destination address, port, and transport. The destination address,\n   port, and transport for the CANCEL MUST be identical to those used to\n   send the original request. If it was allowed to send the CANCEL before receiving a response\n      for the previous request, the server could receive the CANCEL\n      before the original request. Note that both the transaction corresponding to the original request\n   and the CANCEL transaction will complete independently. However, a\n   UAC canceling a request cannot rely on receiving a 487 (Request\n   Terminated) response for the original request, as an RFC 2543-\n   compliant UAS will not generate such a response.", "21": "If there is no\n   final response for the original request in 64*T1 seconds (T1 is    defined in Section 17.1.1.1), the client SHOULD then consider the\n   original transaction cancelled and SHOULD destroy the client\n   transaction handling the original request. 9.2 Server Behavior\n   The CANCEL method requests that the TU at the server side cancel a\n   pending transaction. The TU determines the transaction to be\n   cancelled by taking the CANCEL request, and then assuming that the\n   request method is anything but CANCEL or ACK and applying the\n   transaction matching procedures of Section 17.2.3. The matching\n   transaction is the one to be cancelled. The processing of a CANCEL request at a server depends on the type of\n   server. A stateless proxy will forward it, a stateful proxy might\n   respond to it and generate some CANCEL requests of its own, and a UAS\n   will respond to it. See Section 16.10 for proxy treatment of CANCEL.", "22": "A UAS first processes the CANCEL request according to the general UAS\n   processing described in Section 8.2. However, since CANCEL requests\n   are hop-by-hop and cannot be resubmitted, they cannot be challenged\n   by the server in order to get proper credentials in an Authorization\n   header field. Note also that CANCEL requests do not contain a\n   Require header field. If the UAS did not find a matching transaction for the CANCEL\n   according to the procedure above, it SHOULD respond to the CANCEL\n   with a 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist). If the transaction\n   for the original request still exists, the behavior of the UAS on\n   receiving a CANCEL request depends on whether it has already sent a\n   final response for the original request. If it has, the CANCEL\n   request has no effect on the processing of the original request, no\n   effect on any session state, and no effect on the responses generated\n   for the original request.", "23": "The combination of the To tag, From tag,\n   and Call-ID completely defines a peer-to-peer SIP relationship\n   between Alice and Bob and is referred to as a dialog. CSeq or Command Sequence contains an integer and a method name. The\n   CSeq number is incremented for each new request within a dialog and\n   is a traditional sequence number. Contact contains a SIP or SIPS URI that represents a direct route to\n   contact Alice, usually composed of a username at a fully qualified\n   domain name (FQDN). While an FQDN is preferred, many end systems do\n   not have registered domain names, so IP addresses are permitted. While the Via header field tells other elements where to send the\n   response, the Contact header field tells other elements where to send\n   future requests. Max-Forwards serves to limit the number of hops a request can make on\n   the way to its destination. It consists of an integer that is\n   decremented by one at each hop.", "24": "If the UAS has not issued a final response\n   for the original request, its behavior depends on the method of the\n   original request. If the original request was an INVITE, the UAS\n   SHOULD immediately respond to the INVITE with a 487 (Request\n   Terminated). A CANCEL request has no impact on the processing of\n   transactions with any other method defined in this specification. Regardless of the method of the original request, as long as the\n   CANCEL matched an existing transaction, the UAS answers the CANCEL\n   request itself with a 200 (OK) response. This response is\n   constructed following the procedures described in Section 8.2.6\n   noting that the To tag of the response to the CANCEL and the To tag\n   in the response to the original request SHOULD be the same. The\n   response to CANCEL is passed to the server transaction for\n   transmission. 10 Registrations\n10.1 Overview\n   SIP offers a discovery capability.", "25": "If a user wants to initiate a\n   session with another user, SIP must discover the current host(s) at\n   which the destination user is reachable. This discovery process is\n   frequently accomplished by SIP network elements such as proxy servers\n   and redirect servers which are responsible for receiving a request,\n   determining where to send it based on knowledge of the location of\n   the user, and then sending it there. To do this, SIP network\n   elements consult an abstract service known as a location service,\n   which provides address bindings for a particular domain. These\n   address bindings map an incoming SIP or SIPS URI, sip:bob@biloxi.com,\n   for example, to one or more URIs that are somehow \"closer\" to the\n   desired user, sip:bob@engineering.biloxi.com, for example. Ultimately, a proxy will consult a location service that maps a\n   received URI to the user agent(s) at which the desired recipient is\n   currently residing.", "26": "Registration creates bindings in a location service for a particular\n   domain that associates an address-of-record URI with one or more\n   contact addresses. Thus, when a proxy for that domain receives a\n   request whose Request-URI matches the address-of-record, the proxy\n   will forward the request to the contact addresses registered to that\n   address-of-record. Generally, it only makes sense to register an\n   address-of-record at a domain\u2019s location service when requests for\n   that address-of-record would be routed to that domain. In most\n   cases, this means that the domain of the registration will need to\n   match the domain in the URI of the address-of-record. There are many ways by which the contents of the location service can\n   be established. One way is administratively. In the above example,\n   Bob is known to be a member of the engineering department through\n   access to a corporate database. However, SIP provides a mechanism\n   for a UA to create a binding explicitly.", "27": "This mechanism is known as\n   registration. Registration entails sending a REGISTER request to a special type of\n   UAS known as a registrar. A registrar acts as the front end to the\n   location service for a domain, reading and writing mappings based on\n   the contents of REGISTER requests. This location service is then\n   typically consulted by a proxy server that is responsible for routing\n   requests for that domain. An illustration of the overall registration process is given in\n   Figure 2. Note that the registrar and proxy server are logical roles\n   that can be played by a single device in a network; for purposes of    clarity the two are separated in this illustration. Also note that\n   UAs may send requests through a proxy server in order to reach a\n   registrar if the two are separate elements. SIP does not mandate a particular mechanism for implementing the\n   location service.", "28": "The only requirement is that a registrar for some\n   domain MUST be able to read and write data to the location service,\n   and a proxy or a redirect server for that domain MUST be capable of\n   reading that same data. A registrar MAY be co-located with a\n   particular SIP proxy server for the same domain. 10.2 Constructing the REGISTER Request\n   REGISTER requests add, remove, and query bindings. A REGISTER\n   request can add a new binding between an address-of-record and one or\n   more contact addresses. Registration on behalf of a particular\n   address-of-record can be performed by a suitably authorized third\n   party. A client can also remove previous bindings or query to\n   determine which bindings are currently in place for an address-of-\n   record.

In particular, the UAC MUST NOT create a new route set\n   based on the presence or absence of a Record-Route header field in\n   any response to a REGISTER request. The following header fields, except Contact, MUST be included in a\n   REGISTER request. A Contact header field MAY be included:\n      Request-URI: The Request-URI names the domain of the location\n           service for which the registration is meant (for example,\n           \"sip:chicago.com\").

The address-of-record is included in the To header field\n   of the REGISTER request.

This SDP message (not shown in the    example) is carried by the SIP message in a way that is analogous to\n   a document attachment being carried by an email message, or a web\n   page being carried in an HTTP message. Since the softphone does not know the location of Bob or the SIP\n   server in the biloxi.com domain, the softphone sends the INVITE to\n   the SIP server that serves Alice\u2019s domain, atlanta.com.", "35": "A SIP UA can choose to register telephone numbers (with the tel URL,\n   RFC 2806 [9]) or email addresses (with a mailto URL, RFC 2368 [32])\n   as Contacts for an address-of-record, for example. For example, Carol, with address-of-record \"sip:carol@chicago.com\",\n   would register with the SIP registrar of the domain chicago.com. Her\n   registrations would then be used by a proxy server in the chicago.com\n   domain to route requests for Carol\u2019s address-of-record to her SIP\n   endpoint. Once a client has established bindings at a registrar, it MAY send\n   subsequent registrations containing new bindings or modifications to\n   existing bindings as necessary. The 2xx response to the REGISTER\n   request will contain, in a Contact header field, a complete list of\n   bindings that have been registered for this address-of-record at this\n   registrar.", "36": "If the address-of-record in the To header field of a REGISTER request\n   is a SIPS URI, then any Contact header field values in the request\n   SHOULD also be SIPS URIs.

This may be applicable to URIs that invoke protocols other than SIP,\n   or SIP devices secured by protocols other than TLS. Registrations do not need to update all bindings. Typically, a UA\n   only updates its own contact addresses. 10.2.1.1 Setting the Expiration Interval of Contact Addresses\n   When a client sends a REGISTER request, it MAY suggest an expiration\n   interval that indicates how long the client would like the\n   registration to be valid. (As described in Section 10.3, the\n   registrar selects the actual time interval based on its local\n   policy.)", "37": "There are two ways in which a client can suggest an expiration\n   interval for a binding: through an Expires header field or an\n   \"expires\" Contact header parameter. The latter allows expiration\n   intervals to be suggested on a per-binding basis when more than one\n   binding is given in a single REGISTER request, whereas the former\n   suggests an expiration interval for all Contact header field values\n   that do not contain the \"expires\" parameter. If neither mechanism for expressing a suggested expiration time is\n   present in a REGISTER, the client is indicating its desire for the\n   server to choose. 10.2.1.2 Preferences among Contact Addresses\n   If more than one Contact is sent in a REGISTER request, the\n   registering UA intends to associate all of the URIs in these Contact\n   header field values with the address-of-record present in the To\n   field. This list can be prioritized with the \"q\" parameter in the\n   Contact header field.", "38": "The \"q\" parameter indicates a relative\n   preference for the particular Contact header field value compared to\n   other bindings for this address-of-record. Section 16.6 describes\n   how a proxy server uses this preference indication. 10.2.2 Removing Bindings\n   Registrations are soft state and expire unless refreshed, but can\n   also be explicitly removed. A client can attempt to influence the\n   expiration interval selected by the registrar as described in Section\n   10.2.1. A UA requests the immediate removal of a binding by\n   specifying an expiration interval of \"0\" for that contact address in\n   a REGISTER request. UAs SHOULD support this mechanism so that\n   bindings can be removed before their expiration interval has passed. The REGISTER-specific Contact header field value of \"*\" applies to\n   all registrations, but it MUST NOT be used unless the Expires header\n   field is present with a value of \"0\".", "39": "Use of the \"*\" Contact header field value allows a registering UA\n      to remove all bindings associated with an address-of-record\n      without knowing their precise values. 10.2.3 Fetching Bindings\n   A success response to any REGISTER request contains the complete list\n   of existing bindings, regardless of whether the request contained a\n   Contact header field. If no Contact header field is present in a\n   REGISTER request, the list of bindings is left unchanged. 10.2.4 Refreshing Bindings\n   Each UA is responsible for refreshing the bindings that it has\n   previously established. A UA SHOULD NOT refresh bindings set up by\n   other UAs. The 200 (OK) response from the registrar contains a list of Contact\n   fields enumerating all current bindings. The UA compares each\n   contact address to see if it created the contact address, using\n   comparison rules in Section 19.1.4.", "40": "If so, it updates the expiration\n   time interval according to the expires parameter or, if absent, the\n   Expires field value. The UA then issues a REGISTER request for each\n   of its bindings before the expiration interval has elapsed. It MAY\n   combine several updates into one REGISTER request. A UA SHOULD use the same Call-ID for all registrations during a\n   single boot cycle. Registration refreshes SHOULD be sent to the same\n   network address as the original registration, unless redirected. 10.2.5 Setting the Internal Clock\n   If the response for a REGISTER request contains a Date header field,\n   the client MAY use this header field to learn the current time in\n   order to set any internal clocks. 10.2.6 Discovering a Registrar\n   UAs can use three ways to determine the address to which to send\n   registrations:  by configuration, using the address-of-record, and\n   multicast. A UA can be configured, in ways beyond the scope of this\n   specification, with a registrar address.", "41": "If there is no configured\n   registrar address, the UA SHOULD use the host part of the address-\n   of-record as the Request-URI and address the request there, using the\n   normal SIP server location mechanisms [4]. For example, the UA for\n   the user \"sip:carol@chicago.com\" addresses the REGISTER request to\n   \"sip:chicago.com\". Finally, a UA can be configured to use multicast. Multicast\n   registrations are addressed to the well-known \"all SIP servers\"\n   multicast address \"sip.mcast.net\" (224.0.1.75 for IPv4). No well-\n   known IPv6 multicast address has been allocated; such an allocation\n   will be documented separately when needed. SIP UAs MAY listen to\n   that address and use it to become aware of the location of other\n   local users (see [33]); however, they do not respond to the request. Multicast registration may be inappropriate in some environments,\n      for example, if multiple businesses share the same local area\n      network.", "42": "10.2.7 Transmitting a Request\n   Once the REGISTER method has been constructed, and the destination of\n   the message identified, UACs follow the procedures described in\n   Section 8.1.2 to hand off the REGISTER to the transaction layer. If the transaction layer returns a timeout error because the REGISTER\n   yielded no response, the UAC SHOULD NOT immediately re-attempt a\n   registration to the same registrar. An immediate re-attempt is likely to also timeout. Waiting some\n      reasonable time interval for the conditions causing the timeout to\n      be corrected reduces unnecessary load on the network. No specific\n      interval is mandated. 10.2.8 Error Responses\n   If a UA receives a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response, it MAY retry\n   the registration after making the expiration interval of all contact\n   addresses in the REGISTER request equal to or greater than the\n   expiration interval within the Min-Expires header field of the 423\n   (Interval Too Brief) response.", "43": "10.3 Processing REGISTER Requests\n   A registrar is a UAS that responds to REGISTER requests and maintains\n   a list of bindings that are accessible to proxy servers and redirect\n   servers within its administrative domain. A registrar handles\n   requests according to Section 8.2 and Section 17.2, but it accepts\n   only REGISTER requests. A registrar MUST not generate 6xx responses. A registrar MAY redirect REGISTER requests as appropriate. One\n   common usage would be for a registrar listening on a multicast\n   interface to redirect multicast REGISTER requests to its own unicast\n   interface with a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response. Registrars MUST ignore the Record-Route header field if it is\n   included in a REGISTER request. Registrars MUST NOT include a\n   Record-Route header field in any response to a REGISTER request. A registrar might receive a request that traversed a proxy which\n      treats REGISTER as an unknown request and which added a Record-\n      Route header field value.", "44": "A registrar has to know (for example, through configuration) the set\n   of domain(s) for which it maintains bindings. REGISTER requests MUST\n   be processed by a registrar in the order that they are received. REGISTER requests MUST also be processed atomically, meaning that a\n   particular REGISTER request is either processed completely or not at\n   all. Each REGISTER message MUST be processed independently of any\n   other registration or binding changes. When receiving a REGISTER request, a registrar follows these steps:\n      1. The registrar inspects the Request-URI to determine whether it\n         has access to bindings for the domain identified in the\n         Request-URI. If not, and if the server also acts as a proxy\n         server, the server SHOULD forward the request to the addressed\n         domain, following the general behavior for proxying messages\n         described in Section 16. 2.", "45": "The address\n   of the atlanta.com SIP server could have been configured in Alice\u2019s\n   softphone, or it could have been discovered by DHCP, for example. The atlanta.com SIP server is a type of SIP server known as a proxy\n   server. A proxy server receives SIP requests and forwards them on\n   behalf of the requestor. In this example, the proxy server receives\n   the INVITE request and sends a 100 (Trying) response back to Alice\u2019s\n   softphone. The 100 (Trying) response indicates that the INVITE has\n   been received and that the proxy is working on her behalf to route\n   the INVITE to the destination. Responses in SIP use a three-digit\n   code followed by a descriptive phrase. This response contains the\n   same To, From, Call-ID, CSeq and branch parameter in the Via as the\n   INVITE, which allows Alice\u2019s softphone to correlate this response to\n   the sent INVITE.", "46": "To guarantee that the registrar supports any necessary\n         extensions, the registrar MUST process the Require header field\n         values as described for UASs in Section 8.2.2. 3. A registrar SHOULD authenticate the UAC. Mechanisms for the\n         authentication of SIP user agents are described in Section 22. Registration behavior in no way overrides the generic\n         authentication framework for SIP. If no authentication\n         mechanism is available, the registrar MAY take the From address\n         as the asserted identity of the originator of the request. 4. The registrar SHOULD determine if the authenticated user is\n         authorized to modify registrations for this address-of-record. For example, a registrar might consult an authorization\n         database that maps user names to a list of addresses-of-record\n         for which that user has authorization to modify bindings.", "47": "If\n         the authenticated user is not authorized to modify bindings,\n         the registrar MUST return a 403 (Forbidden) and skip the\n         remaining steps. In architectures that support third-party registration, one\n         entity may be responsible for updating the registrations\n         associated with multiple addresses-of-record. 5. The registrar extracts the address-of-record from the To header\n         field of the request. If the address-of-record is not valid\n         for the domain in the Request-URI, the registrar MUST send a\n         404 (Not Found) response and skip the remaining steps. The URI\n         MUST then be converted to a canonical form. To do that, all\n         URI parameters MUST be removed (including the user-param), and\n         any escaped characters MUST be converted to their unescaped\n         form. The result serves as an index into the list of bindings. 6. The registrar checks whether the request contains the Contact\n         header field.", "48": "If not, it skips to the last step. If the\n         Contact header field is present, the registrar checks if there\n         is one Contact field value that contains the special value \"*\"\n         and an Expires field. If the request has additional Contact\n         fields or an expiration time other than zero, the request is\n         invalid, and the server MUST return a 400 (Invalid Request) and\n         skip the remaining steps. If not, the registrar checks whether\n         the Call-ID agrees with the value stored for each binding. If\n         not, it MUST remove the binding. If it does agree, it MUST\n         remove the binding only if the CSeq in the request is higher\n         than the value stored for that binding. Otherwise, the update\n         MUST be aborted and the request fails. 7. The registrar now processes each contact address in the Contact\n         header field in turn.", "49": "For each address, it determines the\n         expiration interval as follows:\n         -  If the field value has an \"expires\" parameter, that value\n            MUST be taken as the requested expiration. -  If there is no such parameter, but the request has an\n            Expires header field, that value MUST be taken as the\n            requested expiration. -  If there is neither, a locally-configured default value MUST\n            be taken as the requested expiration. The registrar MAY choose an expiration less than the requested\n         expiration interval. If and only if the requested expiration\n         interval is greater than zero AND smaller than one hour AND\n         less than a registrar-configured minimum, the registrar MAY\n         reject the registration with a response of 423 (Interval Too\n         Brief). This response MUST contain a Min-Expires header field\n         that states the minimum expiration interval the registrar is\n         willing to honor.", "50": "It then skips the remaining steps. Allowing the registrar to set the registration interval\n         protects it against excessively frequent registration refreshes\n         while limiting the state that it needs to maintain and\n         decreasing the likelihood of registrations going stale. The\n         expiration interval of a registration is frequently used in the\n         creation of services. An example is a follow-me service, where\n         the user may only be available at a terminal for a brief\n         period. Therefore, registrars should accept brief\n         registrations; a request should only be rejected if the\n         interval is so short that the refreshes would degrade registrar\n         performance. For each address, the registrar then searches the list of\n         current bindings using the URI comparison rules. If the\n         binding does not exist, it is tentatively added. If the\n         binding does exist, the registrar checks the Call-ID value.", "51": "If\n         the Call-ID value in the existing binding differs from the\n         Call-ID value in the request, the binding MUST be removed if\n         the expiration time is zero and updated otherwise. If they are\n         the same, the registrar compares the CSeq value. If the value\n         is higher than that of the existing binding, it MUST update or\n         remove the binding as above. If not, the update MUST be\n         aborted and the request fails. This algorithm ensures that out-of-order requests from the same\n         UA are ignored. Each binding record records the Call-ID and CSeq values from\n         the request. The binding updates MUST be committed (that is, made visible to\n         the proxy or redirect server) if and only if all binding\n         updates and additions succeed.", "52": "If any one of them fails (for\n         example, because the back-end database commit failed), the\n         request MUST fail with a 500 (Server Error) response and all\n         tentative binding updates MUST be removed. 8. The registrar returns a 200 (OK) response. The response MUST\n         contain Contact header field values enumerating all current\n         bindings. Each Contact value MUST feature an \"expires\"\n         parameter indicating its expiration interval chosen by the\n         registrar. The response SHOULD include a Date header field. 11 Querying for Capabilities\n   The SIP method OPTIONS allows a UA to query another UA or a proxy\n   server as to its capabilities. This allows a client to discover\n   information about the supported methods, content types, extensions,\n   codecs, etc. without \"ringing\" the other party.", "53": "For example, before\n   a client inserts a Require header field into an INVITE listing an\n   option that it is not certain the destination UAS supports, the\n   client can query the destination UAS with an OPTIONS to see if this\n   option is returned in a Supported header field. All UAs MUST support\n   the OPTIONS method. The target of the OPTIONS request is identified by the Request-URI,\n   which could identify another UA or a SIP server. If the OPTIONS is\n   addressed to a proxy server, the Request-URI is set without a user\n   part, similar to the way a Request-URI is set for a REGISTER request. Alternatively, a server receiving an OPTIONS request with a Max-\n   Forwards header field value of 0 MAY respond to the request\n   regardless of the Request-URI. This behavior is common with HTTP/1.1.", "54": "This behavior can be used\n      as a \"traceroute\" functionality to check the capabilities of\n      individual hop servers by sending a series of OPTIONS requests\n      with incremented Max-Forwards values. As is the case for general UA behavior, the transaction layer can\n   return a timeout error if the OPTIONS yields no response. This may\n   indicate that the target is unreachable and hence unavailable. An OPTIONS request MAY be sent as part of an established dialog to\n   query the peer on capabilities that may be utilized later in the\n   dialog. 11.1 Construction of OPTIONS Request\n   An OPTIONS request is constructed using the standard rules for a SIP\n   request as discussed in Section 8.1.1. A Contact header field MAY be present in an OPTIONS. An Accept header field SHOULD be included to indicate the type of\n   message body the UAC wishes to receive in the response.", "55": "Typically,\n   this is set to a format that is used to describe the media\n   capabilities of a UA, such as SDP (application/sdp). The response to an OPTIONS request is assumed to be scoped to the\n   Request-URI in the original request. However, only when an OPTIONS\n   is sent as part of an established dialog is it guaranteed that future\n   requests will be received by the server that generated the OPTIONS\n   response.

Before forwarding the request,\n   the atlanta.com proxy server adds an additional Via header field\n   value that contains its own address (the INVITE already contains\n   Alice\u2019s address in the first Via). The biloxi.com proxy server\n   receives the INVITE and responds with a 100 (Trying) response back to\n   the atlanta.com proxy server to indicate that it has received the\n   INVITE and is processing the request. The proxy server consults a\n   database, generically called a location service, that contains the\n   current IP address of Bob. (We shall see in the next section how\n   this database can be populated.)", "57": "The response code\n   chosen MUST be the same that would have been chosen had the request\n   been an INVITE. That is, a 200 (OK) would be returned if the UAS is\n   ready to accept a call, a 486 (Busy Here) would be returned if the\n   UAS is busy, etc. This allows an OPTIONS request to be used to\n   determine the basic state of a UAS, which can be an indication of\n   whether the UAS will accept an INVITE request. An OPTIONS request received within a dialog generates a 200 (OK)\n   response that is identical to one constructed outside a dialog and\n   does not have any impact on the dialog. This use of OPTIONS has limitations due to the differences in proxy\n   handling of OPTIONS and INVITE requests. While a forked INVITE can\n   result in multiple 200 (OK) responses being returned, a forked\n   OPTIONS will only result in a single 200 (OK) response, since it is\n   treated by proxies using the non-INVITE handling. See Section 16.7\n   for the normative details.", "58": "If the response to an OPTIONS is generated by a proxy server, the\n   proxy returns a 200 (OK), listing the capabilities of the server. The response does not contain a message body. Allow, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, and Supported header\n   fields SHOULD be present in a 200 (OK) response to an OPTIONS\n   request. If the response is generated by a proxy, the Allow header\n   field SHOULD be omitted as it is ambiguous since a proxy is method\n   agnostic. Contact header fields MAY be present in a 200 (OK)\n   response and have the same semantics as in a 3xx response. That is,\n   they may list a set of alternative names and methods of reaching the\n   user. A Warning header field MAY be present.

The dialog facilitates sequencing of\n   messages between the user agents and proper routing of requests\n   between both of them. The dialog represents a context in which to\n   interpret SIP messages. Section 8 discussed method independent UA\n   processing for requests and responses outside of a dialog. This\n   section discusses how those requests and responses are used to\n   construct a dialog, and then how subsequent requests and responses\n   are sent within a dialog. A dialog is identified at each UA with a dialog ID, which consists of\n   a Call-ID value, a local tag and a remote tag. The dialog ID at each\n   UA involved in the dialog is not the same. Specifically, the local\n   tag at one UA is identical to the remote tag at the peer UA. The\n   tags are opaque tokens that facilitate the generation of unique\n   dialog IDs.", "61": "A dialog ID is also associated with all responses and with any\n   request that contains a tag in the To field. The rules for computing\n   the dialog ID of a message depend on whether the SIP element is a UAC\n   or UAS. For a UAC, the Call-ID value of the dialog ID is set to the\n   Call-ID of the message, the remote tag is set to the tag in the To\n   field of the message, and the local tag is set to the tag in the From    field of the message (these rules apply to both requests and\n   responses). As one would expect for a UAS, the Call-ID value of the\n   dialog ID is set to the Call-ID of the message, the remote tag is set\n   to the tag in the From field of the message, and the local tag is set\n   to the tag in the To field of the message. A dialog contains certain pieces of state needed for further message\n   transmissions within the dialog.", "62": "This state consists of the dialog\n   ID, a local sequence number (used to order requests from the UA to\n   its peer), a remote sequence number (used to order requests from its\n   peer to the UA), a local URI, a remote URI, remote target, a boolean\n   flag called \"secure\", and a route set, which is an ordered list of\n   URIs. The route set is the list of servers that need to be traversed\n   to send a request to the peer. A dialog can also be in the \"early\"\n   state, which occurs when it is created with a provisional response,\n   and then transition to the \"confirmed\" state when a 2xx final\n   response arrives. For other responses, or if no response arrives at\n   all on that dialog, the early dialog terminates. 12.1 Creation of a Dialog\n   Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses\n   to requests with specific methods. Within this specification, only\n   2xx and 101-199 responses with a To tag, where the request was\n   INVITE, will establish a dialog.", "63": "A dialog established by a non-final\n   response to a request is in the \"early\" state and it is called an\n   early dialog. Extensions MAY define other means for creating\n   dialogs. Section 13 gives more details that are specific to the\n   INVITE method. Here, we describe the process for creation of dialog\n   state that is not dependent on the method. UAs MUST assign values to the dialog ID components as described\n   below. 12.1.1 UAS behavior\n   When a UAS responds to a request with a response that establishes a\n   dialog (such as a 2xx to INVITE), the UAS MUST copy all Record-Route\n   header field values from the request into the response (including the\n   URIs, URI parameters, and any Record-Route header field parameters,\n   whether they are known or unknown to the UAS) and MUST maintain the\n   order of those values.

Generally, the host portion of this URI is the IP address or FQDN of\n   the host. The URI provided in the Contact header field MUST be a SIP\n   or SIPS URI. If the request that initiated the dialog contained a    SIPS URI in the Request-URI or in the top Record-Route header field\n   value, if there was any, or the Contact header field if there was no\n   Record-Route header field, the Contact header field in the response\n   MUST be a SIPS URI. The URI SHOULD have global scope (that is, the\n   same URI can be used in messages outside this dialog). The same way,\n   the scope of the URI in the Contact header field of the INVITE is not\n   limited to this dialog either. It can therefore be used in messages\n   to the UAC even outside this dialog. The UAS then constructs the state of the dialog.", "65": "This state MUST be\n   maintained for the duration of the dialog.

Usage of the URI from the To and From fields in the original\n      request within subsequent requests is done for backwards\n      compatibility with RFC 2543, which used the URI for dialog\n      identification. In this specification, only the tags are used for\n      dialog identification. It is expected that mandatory reflection\n      of the original To and From URI in mid-dialog requests will be\n      deprecated in a subsequent revision of this specification. The Call-ID of the request MUST be set to the Call-ID of the dialog. Requests within a dialog MUST contain strictly monotonically\n   increasing and contiguous CSeq sequence numbers (increasing-by-one)\n   in each direction (excepting ACK and CANCEL of course, whose numbers\n   equal the requests being acknowledged or cancelled).", "73": "Therefore, if\n   the local sequence number is not empty, the value of the local\n   sequence number MUST be incremented by one, and this value MUST be\n   placed into the CSeq header field. If the local sequence number is\n   empty, an initial value MUST be chosen using the guidelines of\n   Section 8.1.1.5.

With a length of 32 bits, a client could generate, within a single\n      call, one request a second for about 136 years before needing to\n      wrap around. The initial value of the sequence number is chosen\n      so that subsequent requests within the same call will not wrap\n      around. A non-zero initial value allows clients to use a time-\n      based initial sequence number. A client could, for example,\n      choose the 31 most significant bits of a 32-bit second clock as an\n      initial sequence number.", "74": "The UAC uses the remote target and route set to build the Request-URI\n   and Route header field of the request.

Placing the\n      Request-URI at the end of the Route header field preserves the       information in that Request-URI across the strict router (it will\n      be returned to the Request-URI when the request reaches a loose-\n      router).", "76": "A UAC SHOULD include a Contact header field in any target refresh\n   requests within a dialog, and unless there is a need to change it,\n   the URI SHOULD be the same as used in previous requests within the\n   dialog.

This allows a UA to\n   provide a new contact address, should its address change during the\n   duration of the dialog. However, requests that are not target refresh requests do not affect\n   the remote target URI for the dialog. The rest of the request is formed as described in Section 8.1.1.

Subject to certain restrictions, they allow the request\n      to be sent to an alternate address (such as a default outbound\n      proxy not represented in the route set). 12.2.1.2 Processing the Responses\n   The UAC will receive responses to the request from the transaction\n   layer. If the client transaction returns a timeout, this is treated\n   as a 408 (Request Timeout) response. The behavior of a UAC that receives a 3xx response for a request sent\n   within a dialog is the same as if the request had been sent outside a\n   dialog. This behavior is described in Section 8.1.3.4. Note, however, that when the UAC tries alternative locations, it\n      still uses the route set for the dialog to build the Route header\n      of the request.", "78": "When Alice\u2019s softphone receives the 180 (Ringing) response, it passes\n   this information to Alice, perhaps using an audio ringback tone or by\n   displaying a message on Alice\u2019s screen. In this example, Bob decides to answer the call. When he picks up\n   the handset, his SIP phone sends a 200 (OK) response to indicate that\n   the call has been answered. The 200 (OK) contains a message body\n   with the SDP media description of the type of session that Bob is\n   willing to establish with Alice. As a result, there is a two-phase\n   exchange of SDP messages: Alice sent one to Bob, and Bob sent one\n   back to Alice. This two-phase exchange provides basic negotiation\n   capabilities and is based on a simple offer/answer model of SDP\n   exchange. If Bob did not wish to answer the call or was busy on\n   another call, an error response would have been sent instead of the\n   200 (OK), which would have resulted in no media session being\n   established.", "79": "When a UAC receives a 2xx response to a target refresh request, it\n   MUST replace the dialog\u2019s remote target URI with the URI from the\n   Contact header field in that response, if present.

A UAC SHOULD also terminate a dialog if\n   no response at all is received for the request (the client\n   transaction would inform the TU about the timeout.) For INVITE initiated dialogs, terminating the dialog consists of\n      sending a BYE. 12.2.2 UAS Behavior\n   Requests sent within a dialog, as any other requests, are atomic. If\n   a particular request is accepted by the UAS, all the state changes\n   associated with it are performed. If the request is rejected, none\n   of the state changes are performed.

If the request has a tag in the To header field, but the dialog\n   identifier does not match any existing dialogs, the UAS may have\n   crashed and restarted, or it may have received a request for a\n   different (possibly failed) UAS (the UASs can construct the To tags\n   so that a UAS can identify that the tag was for a UAS for which it is\n   providing recovery). Another possibility is that the incoming\n   request has been simply misrouted. Based on the To tag, the UAS MAY\n   either accept or reject the request. Accepting the request for\n   acceptable To tags provides robustness, so that dialogs can persist\n   even through crashes.", "81": "UAs wishing to support this capability must\n   take into consideration some issues such as choosing monotonically\n   increasing CSeq sequence numbers even across reboots, reconstructing\n   the route set, and accepting out-of-range RTP timestamps and sequence\n   numbers. If the UAS wishes to reject the request because it does not wish to\n   recreate the dialog, it MUST respond to the request with a 481\n   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) status code and pass that to the\n   server transaction. Requests that do not change in any way the state of a dialog may be\n   received within a dialog (for example, an OPTIONS request).

If the remote sequence number was not empty, and\n   the sequence number of the request is greater than the remote\n   sequence number, the request is in order. It is possible for the\n   CSeq sequence number to be higher than the remote sequence number by\n   more than one. This is not an error condition, and a UAS SHOULD be\n   prepared to receive and process requests with CSeq values more than\n   one higher than the previous received request. The UAS MUST then set\n   the remote sequence number to the value of the sequence number in the\n   CSeq header field value in the request. If a proxy challenges a request generated by the UAC, the UAC has\n      to resubmit the request with credentials. The resubmitted request\n      will have a new CSeq number.", "83": "The UAS will never see the first\n      request, and thus, it will notice a gap in the CSeq number space. Such a gap does not represent any error condition. When a UAS receives a target refresh request, it MUST replace the\n   dialog\u2019s remote target URI with the URI from the Contact header field\n   in that request, if present. 12.3 Termination of a Dialog\n   Independent of the method, if a request outside of a dialog generates\n   a non-2xx final response, any early dialogs created through\n   provisional responses to that request are terminated. The mechanism\n   for terminating confirmed dialogs is method specific. In this\n   specification, the BYE method terminates a session and the dialog\n   associated with it. See Section 15 for details. 13 Initiating a Session\n13.1 Overview\n   When a user agent client desires to initiate a session (for example,\n   audio, video, or a game), it formulates an INVITE request. The\n   INVITE request asks a server to establish a session.", "84": "This request\n   may be forwarded by proxies, eventually arriving at one or more UAS\n   that can potentially accept the invitation. These UASs will\n   frequently need to query the user about whether to accept the    invitation. After some time, those UASs can accept the invitation\n   (meaning the session is to be established) by sending a 2xx response. If the invitation is not accepted, a 3xx, 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response is\n   sent, depending on the reason for the rejection. Before sending a\n   final response, the UAS can also send provisional responses (1xx) to\n   advise the UAC of progress in contacting the called user. After possibly receiving one or more provisional responses, the UAC\n   will get one or more 2xx responses or one non-2xx final response. Because of the protracted amount of time it can take to receive final\n   responses to INVITE, the reliability mechanisms for INVITE\n   transactions differ from those of other requests (like OPTIONS).", "85": "Once it receives a final response, the UAC needs to send an ACK for\n   every final response it receives. The procedure for sending this ACK\n   depends on the type of response. For final responses between 300 and\n   699, the ACK processing is done in the transaction layer and follows\n   one set of rules (See Section 17). For 2xx responses, the ACK is\n   generated by the UAC core. A 2xx response to an INVITE establishes a session, and it also\n   creates a dialog between the UA that issued the INVITE and the UA\n   that generated the 2xx response. Therefore, when multiple 2xx\n   responses are received from different remote UAs (because the INVITE\n   forked), each 2xx establishes a different dialog. All these dialogs\n   are part of the same call. This section provides details on the establishment of a session using\n   INVITE. A UA that supports INVITE MUST also support ACK, CANCEL and\n   BYE.", "86": "13.2 UAC Processing\n13.2.1 Creating the Initial INVITE\n   Since the initial INVITE represents a request outside of a dialog,\n   its construction follows the procedures of Section 8.1.1. Additional\n   processing is required for the specific case of INVITE. An Allow header field (Section 20.5) SHOULD be present in the INVITE. It indicates what methods can be invoked within a dialog, on the UA\n   sending the INVITE, for the duration of the dialog. For example, a\n   UA capable of receiving INFO requests within a dialog [34] SHOULD\n   include an Allow header field listing the INFO method. A Supported header field (Section 20.37) SHOULD be present in the\n   INVITE. It enumerates all the extensions understood by the UAC. An Accept (Section 20.1) header field MAY be present in the INVITE. It indicates which Content-Types are acceptable to the UA, in both\n   the response received by it, and in any subsequent requests sent to\n   it within dialogs established by the INVITE.", "87": "The Accept header field\n   is especially useful for indicating support of various session\n   description formats. The UAC MAY add an Expires header field (Section 20.19) to limit the\n   validity of the invitation. If the time indicated in the Expires\n   header field is reached and no final answer for the INVITE has been\n   received, the UAC core SHOULD generate a CANCEL request for the\n   INVITE, as per Section 9. A UAC MAY also find it useful to add, among others, Subject (Section\n   20.36), Organization (Section 20.25) and User-Agent (Section 20.41)\n   header fields. They all contain information related to the INVITE. The UAC MAY choose to add a message body to the INVITE. Section\n   8.1.1.10 deals with how to construct the header fields -- Content-\n   Type among others -- needed to describe the message body.

Section 12.2.2 provides\n         guidelines to achieve a robust behavior under such a situation. Processing from here forward assumes that the INVITE is outside of a\n   dialog, and is thus for the purposes of establishing a new session. The INVITE may contain a session description, in which case the UAS\n   is being presented with an offer for that session. It is possible\n   that the user is already a participant in that session, even though\n   the INVITE is outside of a dialog.

If the INVITE does not contain a session description, the UAS is\n   being asked to participate in a session, and the UAC has asked that\n   the UAS provide the offer of the session. It MUST provide the offer\n   in its first non-failure reliable message back to the UAC. In this\n   specification, that is a 2xx response to the INVITE. The UAS can indicate progress, accept, redirect, or reject the\n   invitation. In all of these cases, it formulates a response using\n   the procedures described in Section 8.2.6.", "103": "13.3.1.1 Progress\n   If the UAS is not able to answer the invitation immediately, it can\n   choose to indicate some kind of progress to the UAC (for example, an\n   indication that a phone is ringing).

These provisional\n   responses establish early dialogs and therefore follow the procedures\n   of Section 12.1.1 in addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A UAS MAY\n   send as many provisional responses as it likes. Each of these MUST\n   indicate the same dialog ID. However, these will not be delivered\n   reliably. If the UAS desires an extended period of time to answer the INVITE,\n   it will need to ask for an \"extension\" in order to prevent proxies\n   from canceling the transaction. A proxy has the option of canceling\n   a transaction when there is a gap of 3 minutes between responses in a\n   transaction.", "104": "To prevent cancellation, the UAS MUST send a non-100\n   provisional response at every minute, to handle the possibility of\n   lost provisional responses. An INVITE transaction can go on for extended durations when the\n      user is placed on hold, or when interworking with PSTN systems\n      which allow communications to take place without answering the\n      call. The latter is common in Interactive Voice Response (IVR)\n      systems. 13.3.1.2 The INVITE is Redirected\n   If the UAS decides to redirect the call, a 3xx response is sent. A\n   300 (Multiple Choices), 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved\n   Temporarily) response SHOULD contain a Contact header field    containing one or more URIs of new addresses to be tried. The\n   response is passed to the INVITE server transaction, which will deal\n   with its retransmissions. 13.3.1.3 The INVITE is Rejected\n   A common scenario occurs when the callee is currently not willing or\n   able to take additional calls at this end system.", "105": "A 486 (Busy Here)\n   SHOULD be returned in such a scenario. If the UAS knows that no\n   other end system will be able to accept this call, a 600 (Busy\n   Everywhere) response SHOULD be sent instead. However, it is unlikely\n   that a UAS will be able to know this in general, and thus this\n   response will not usually be used. The response is passed to the\n   INVITE server transaction, which will deal with its retransmissions. A UAS rejecting an offer contained in an INVITE SHOULD return a 488\n   (Not Acceptable Here) response. Such a response SHOULD include a\n   Warning header field value explaining why the offer was rejected. 13.3.1.4 The INVITE is Accepted\n   The UAS core generates a 2xx response. This response establishes a\n   dialog, and therefore follows the procedures of Section 12.1.1 in\n   addition to those of Section 8.2.6. A 2xx response to an INVITE SHOULD contain the Allow header field and\n   the Supported header field, and MAY contain the Accept header field.", "106": "Including these header fields allows the UAC to determine the\n   features and extensions supported by the UAS for the duration of the\n   call, without probing. If the INVITE request contained an offer, and the UAS had not yet\n   sent an answer, the 2xx MUST contain an answer. If the INVITE did\n   not contain an offer, the 2xx MUST contain an offer if the UAS had\n   not yet sent an offer. Once the response has been constructed, it is passed to the INVITE\n   server transaction. Note, however, that the INVITE server\n   transaction will be destroyed as soon as it receives this final\n   response and passes it to the transport. Therefore, it is necessary\n   to periodically pass the response directly to the transport until the\n   ACK arrives. The 2xx response is passed to the transport with an\n   interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles for each\n   retransmission until it reaches T2 seconds (T1 and T2 are defined in\n   Section 17).", "107": "Response retransmissions cease when an ACK request for\n   the response is received. This is independent of whatever transport\n   protocols are used to send the response. Since 2xx is retransmitted end-to-end, there may be hops between\n      UAS and UAC that are UDP. To ensure reliable delivery across\n      these hops, the response is retransmitted periodically even if the\n      transport at the UAS is reliable. If the server retransmits the 2xx response for 64*T1 seconds without\n   receiving an ACK, the dialog is confirmed, but the session SHOULD be\n   terminated. This is accomplished with a BYE, as described in Section\n   15. 14 Modifying an Existing Session\n   A successful INVITE request (see Section 13) establishes both a\n   dialog between two user agents and a session using the offer-answer\n   model. Section 12 explains how to modify an existing dialog using a\n   target refresh request (for example, changing the remote target URI\n   of the dialog).", "108": "This section describes how to modify the actual\n   session. This modification can involve changing addresses or ports,\n   adding a media stream, deleting a media stream, and so on. This is\n   accomplished by sending a new INVITE request within the same dialog\n   that established the session. An INVITE request sent within an\n   existing dialog is known as a re-INVITE. Note that a single re-INVITE can modify the dialog and the\n      parameters of the session at the same time. Either the caller or callee can modify an existing session. The behavior of a UA on detection of media failure is a matter of\n   local policy. However, automated generation of re-INVITE or BYE is\n   NOT RECOMMENDED to avoid flooding the network with traffic when there\n   is congestion. In any case, if these messages are sent\n   automatically, they SHOULD be sent after some randomized interval. Note that the paragraph above refers to automatically generated\n      BYEs and re-INVITEs.", "109": "If the user hangs up upon media failure, the\n      UA would send a BYE request as usual. 14.1 UAC Behavior\n   The same offer-answer model that applies to session descriptions in\n   INVITEs (Section 13.2.1) applies to re-INVITEs. As a result, a UAC\n   that wants to add a media stream, for example, will create a new\n   offer that contains this media stream, and send that in an INVITE\n   request to its peer. It is important to note that the full\n   description of the session, not just the change, is sent. This\n   supports stateless session processing in various elements, and\n   supports failover and recovery capabilities. Of course, a UAC MAY    send a re-INVITE with no session description, in which case the first\n   reliable non-failure response to the re-INVITE will contain the offer\n   (in this specification, that is a 2xx response).", "110": "If the session description format has the capability for version\n   numbers, the offerer SHOULD indicate that the version of the session\n   description has changed. The To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, and Request-URI of a re-INVITE are set\n   following the same rules as for regular requests within an existing\n   dialog, described in Section 12. A UAC MAY choose not to add an Alert-Info header field or a body with\n   Content-Disposition \"alert\" to re-INVITEs because UASs do not\n   typically alert the user upon reception of a re-INVITE. Unlike an INVITE, which can fork, a re-INVITE will never fork, and\n   therefore, only ever generate a single final response. The reason a\n   re-INVITE will never fork is that the Request-URI identifies the\n   target as the UA instance it established the dialog with, rather than\n   identifying an address-of-record for the user.", "111": "For locating prospective session participants, and\n   for other functions, SIP enables the creation of an infrastructure of\n   network hosts (called proxy servers) to which user agents can send\n   registrations, invitations to sessions, and other requests.

In this case, the 200 (OK) is routed back through the two proxies and\n   is received by Alice\u2019s softphone, which then stops the ringback tone\n   and indicates that the call has been answered. Finally, Alice\u2019s\n   softphone sends an acknowledgement message, ACK, to Bob\u2019s SIP phone\n   to confirm the reception of the final response (200 (OK)). In this\n   example, the ACK is sent directly from Alice\u2019s softphone to Bob\u2019s SIP\n   phone, bypassing the two proxies. This occurs because the endpoints\n   have learned each other\u2019s address from the Contact header fields\n   through the INVITE/200 (OK) exchange, which was not known when the\n   initial INVITE was sent. The lookups performed by the two proxies\n   are no longer needed, so the proxies drop out of the call flow.

If a UA receives a non-2xx final response to a re-INVITE, the session\n   parameters MUST remain unchanged, as if no re-INVITE had been issued.", "114": "Note that, as stated in Section 12.2.1.2, if the non-2xx final\n   response is a 481 (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist), or a 408\n   (Request Timeout), or no response at all is received for the re-\n   INVITE (that is, a timeout is returned by the INVITE client\n   transaction), the UAC will terminate the dialog. If a UAC receives a 491 response to a re-INVITE, it SHOULD start a\n   timer with a value T chosen as follows:\n      1. If the UAC is the owner of the Call-ID of the dialog ID\n         (meaning it generated the value), T has a randomly chosen value\n         between 2.1 and 4 seconds in units of 10 ms.\n      2. If the UAC is not the owner of the Call-ID of the dialog ID, T\n         has a randomly chosen value of between 0 and 2 seconds in units\n         of 10 ms. When the timer fires, the UAC SHOULD attempt the re-INVITE once more,\n   if it still desires for that session modification to take place.", "115": "For\n   example, if the call was already hung up with a BYE, the re-INVITE\n   would not take place.

A UAS that receives a second INVITE before it sends the final\n   response to a first INVITE with a lower CSeq sequence number on the\n   same dialog MUST return a 500 (Server Internal Error) response to the\n   second INVITE and MUST include a Retry-After header field with a\n   randomly chosen value of between 0 and 10 seconds. A UAS that receives an INVITE on a dialog while an INVITE it had sent\n   on that dialog is in progress MUST return a 491 (Request Pending)\n   response to the received INVITE.", "116": "If a UA receives a re-INVITE for an existing dialog, it MUST check\n   any version identifiers in the session description or, if there are\n   no version identifiers, the content of the session description to see\n   if it has changed. If the session description has changed, the UAS\n   MUST adjust the session parameters accordingly, possibly after asking\n   the user for confirmation. Versioning of the session description can be used to accommodate\n      the capabilities of new arrivals to a conference, add or delete\n      media, or change from a unicast to a multicast conference. If the new session description is not acceptable, the UAS can reject\n   it by returning a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response for the re-\n   INVITE. This response SHOULD include a Warning header field. If a UAS generates a 2xx response and never receives an ACK, it\n   SHOULD generate a BYE to terminate the dialog.", "117": "A UAS MAY choose not to generate 180 (Ringing) responses for a re-\n   INVITE because UACs do not typically render this information to the\n   user. For the same reason, UASs MAY choose not to use an Alert-Info\n   header field or a body with Content-Disposition \"alert\" in responses\n   to a re-INVITE. A UAS providing an offer in a 2xx (because the INVITE did not contain\n   an offer) SHOULD construct the offer as if the UAS were making a\n   brand new call, subject to the constraints of sending an offer that\n   updates an existing session, as described in [13] in the case of SDP. Specifically, this means that it SHOULD include as many media formats\n   and media types that the UA is willing to support. The UAS MUST\n   ensure that the session description overlaps with its previous\n   session description in media formats, transports, or other parameters\n   that require support from the peer. This is to avoid the need for\n   the peer to reject the session description.", "118": "If, however, it is\n   unacceptable to the UAC, the UAC SHOULD generate an answer with a\n   valid session description, and then send a BYE to terminate the\n   session. 15 Terminating a Session\n   This section describes the procedures for terminating a session\n   established by SIP. The state of the session and the state of the\n   dialog are very closely related. When a session is initiated with an\n   INVITE, each 1xx or 2xx response from a distinct UAS creates a\n   dialog, and if that response completes the offer/answer exchange, it\n   also creates a session. As a result, each session is \"associated\"\n   with a single dialog - the one which resulted in its creation. If an\n   initial INVITE generates a non-2xx final response, that terminates\n   all sessions (if any) and all dialogs (if any) that were created\n   through responses to the request. By virtue of completing the\n   transaction, a non-2xx final response also prevents further sessions\n   from being created as a result of the INVITE.", "119": "The BYE request is\n   used to terminate a specific session or attempted session. In this\n   case, the specific session is the one with the peer UA on the other\n   side of the dialog. When a BYE is received on a dialog, any session\n   associated with that dialog SHOULD terminate. A UA MUST NOT send a\n   BYE outside of a dialog. The caller\u2019s UA MAY send a BYE for either\n   confirmed or early dialogs, and the callee\u2019s UA MAY send a BYE on\n   confirmed dialogs, but MUST NOT send a BYE on early dialogs. However, the callee\u2019s UA MUST NOT send a BYE on a confirmed dialog\n   until it has received an ACK for its 2xx response or until the server\n   transaction times out. If no SIP extensions have defined other\n   application layer states associated with the dialog, the BYE also\n   terminates the dialog. The impact of a non-2xx final response to INVITE on dialogs and\n   sessions makes the use of CANCEL attractive. The CANCEL attempts to\n   force a non-2xx response to the INVITE (in particular, a 487).", "120": "Therefore, if a UAC wishes to give up on its call attempt entirely,\n   it can send a CANCEL. If the INVITE results in 2xx final response(s)\n   to the INVITE, this means that a UAS accepted the invitation while\n   the CANCEL was in progress. The UAC MAY continue with the sessions\n   established by any 2xx responses, or MAY terminate them with BYE. The notion of \"hanging up\" is not well defined within SIP. It is\n      specific to a particular, albeit common, user interface. Typically, when the user hangs up, it indicates a desire to\n      terminate the attempt to establish a session, and to terminate any\n      sessions already created. For the caller\u2019s UA, this would imply a\n      CANCEL request if the initial INVITE has not generated a final\n      response, and a BYE to all confirmed dialogs after a final\n      response.", "121": "For the callee\u2019s UA, it would typically imply a BYE;\n      presumably, when the user picked up the phone, a 2xx was\n      generated, and so hanging up would result in a BYE after the ACK\n      is received. This does not mean a user cannot hang up before\n      receipt of the ACK, it just means that the software in his phone\n      needs to maintain state for a short while in order to clean up\n      properly. If the particular UI allows for the user to reject a\n      call before its answered, a 403 (Forbidden) is a good way to\n      express that. As per the rules above, a BYE can\u2019t be sent. 15.1 Terminating a Session with a BYE Request\n15.1.1 UAC Behavior\n   A BYE request is constructed as would any other request within a\n   dialog, as described in Section 12. Once the BYE is constructed, the UAC core creates a new non-INVITE\n   client transaction, and passes it the BYE request.", "122": "The UAC MUST\n   consider the session terminated (and therefore stop sending or\n   listening for media) as soon as the BYE request is passed to the\n   client transaction. If the response for the BYE is a 481\n   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) or a 408 (Request Timeout) or no    response at all is received for the BYE (that is, a timeout is\n   returned by the client transaction), the UAC MUST consider the\n   session and the dialog terminated. 15.1.2 UAS Behavior\n   A UAS first processes the BYE request according to the general UAS\n   processing described in Section 8.2. A UAS core receiving a BYE\n   request checks if it matches an existing dialog. If the BYE does not\n   match an existing dialog, the UAS core SHOULD generate a 481\n   (Call/Transaction Does Not Exist) response and pass that to the\n   server transaction. This rule means that a BYE sent without tags by a UAC will be\n      rejected. This is a change from RFC 2543, which allowed BYE\n      without tags.", "123": "Alice and Bob\u2019s media session has now begun, and they send media\n   packets using the format to which they agreed in the exchange of SDP. In general, the end-to-end media packets take a different path from\n   the SIP signaling messages. During the session, either Alice or Bob may decide to change the\n   characteristics of the media session. This is accomplished by\n   sending a re-INVITE containing a new media description. This re-\n   INVITE references the existing dialog so that the other party knows\n   that it is to modify an existing session instead of establishing a\n   new session. The other party sends a 200 (OK) to accept the change. The requestor responds to the 200 (OK) with an ACK. If the other\n   party does not accept the change, he sends an error response such as\n   488 (Not Acceptable Here), which also receives an ACK. However, the\n   failure of the re-INVITE does not cause the existing call to fail -\n   the session continues using the previously negotiated\n   characteristics.", "124": "A UAS core receiving a BYE request for an existing dialog MUST follow\n   the procedures of Section 12.2.2 to process the request. Once done,\n   the UAS SHOULD terminate the session (and therefore stop sending and\n   listening for media). The only case where it can elect not to are\n   multicast sessions, where participation is possible even if the other\n   participant in the dialog has terminated its involvement in the\n   session. Whether or not it ends its participation on the session,\n   the UAS core MUST generate a 2xx response to the BYE, and MUST pass\n   that to the server transaction for transmission. The UAS MUST still respond to any pending requests received for that\n   dialog. It is RECOMMENDED that a 487 (Request Terminated) response\n   be generated to those pending requests. 16 Proxy Behavior\n16.1 Overview\n   SIP proxies are elements that route SIP requests to user agent\n   servers and SIP responses to user agent clients.", "125": "A request may\n   traverse several proxies on its way to a UAS. Each will make routing\n   decisions, modifying the request before forwarding it to the next\n   element. Responses will route through the same set of proxies\n   traversed by the request in the reverse order. Being a proxy is a logical role for a SIP element. When a request\n   arrives, an element that can play the role of a proxy first decides\n   if it needs to respond to the request on its own. For instance, the\n   request may be malformed or the element may need credentials from the\n   client before acting as a proxy. The element MAY respond with any    appropriate error code. When responding directly to a request, the\n   element is playing the role of a UAS and MUST behave as described in\n   Section 8.2. A proxy can operate in either a stateful or stateless mode for each\n   new request. When stateless, a proxy acts as a simple forwarding\n   element.", "126": "It forwards each request downstream to a single element\n   determined by making a targeting and routing decision based on the\n   request. It simply forwards every response it receives upstream. A\n   stateless proxy discards information about a message once the message\n   has been forwarded. A stateful proxy remembers information\n   (specifically, transaction state) about each incoming request and any\n   requests it sends as a result of processing the incoming request. It\n   uses this information to affect the processing of future messages\n   associated with that request. A stateful proxy MAY choose to \"fork\"\n   a request, routing it to multiple destinations. Any request that is\n   forwarded to more than one location MUST be handled statefully. In some circumstances, a proxy MAY forward requests using stateful\n   transports (such as TCP) without being transaction-stateful.", "127": "For\n   instance, a proxy MAY forward a request from one TCP connection to\n   another transaction statelessly as long as it places enough\n   information in the message to be able to forward the response down\n   the same connection the request arrived on. Requests forwarded\n   between different types of transports where the proxy\u2019s TU must take\n   an active role in ensuring reliable delivery on one of the transports\n   MUST be forwarded transaction statefully. A stateful proxy MAY transition to stateless operation at any time\n   during the processing of a request, so long as it did not do anything\n   that would otherwise prevent it from being stateless initially\n   (forking, for example, or generation of a 100 response). When\n   performing such a transition, all state is simply discarded. The\n   proxy SHOULD NOT initiate a CANCEL request. Much of the processing involved when acting statelessly or statefully\n   for a request is identical.", "128": "The next several subsections are written\n   from the point of view of a stateful proxy. The last section calls\n   out those places where a stateless proxy behaves differently. 16.2 Stateful Proxy\n   When stateful, a proxy is purely a SIP transaction processing engine. Its behavior is modeled here in terms of the server and client\n   transactions defined in Section 17. A stateful proxy has a server\n   transaction associated with one or more client transactions by a\n   higher layer proxy processing component (see figure 3), known as a\n   proxy core. An incoming request is processed by a server    transaction. Requests from the server transaction are passed to a\n   proxy core. The proxy core determines where to route the request,\n   choosing one or more next-hop locations. An outgoing request for\n   each next-hop location is processed by its own associated client\n   transaction.", "129": "The proxy core collects the responses from the client\n   transactions and uses them to send responses to the server\n   transaction. A stateful proxy creates a new server transaction for each new\n   request received. Any retransmissions of the request will then be\n   handled by that server transaction per Section 17. The proxy core\n   MUST behave as a UAS with respect to sending an immediate provisional\n   on that server transaction (such as 100 Trying) as described in\n   Section 8.2.6. Thus, a stateful proxy SHOULD NOT generate 100\n   (Trying) responses to non-INVITE requests. This is a model of proxy behavior, not of software. An\n   implementation is free to take any approach that replicates the\n   external behavior this model defines. For all new requests, including any with unknown methods, an element\n   intending to proxy the request MUST:\n      1. Validate the request (Section 16.3)\n      2.

Process all responses (Section 16.7)\n16.3 Request Validation\n   Before an element can proxy a request, it MUST verify the message\u2019s\n   validity. A valid message must pass the following checks:\n      1.", "131": "Reasonable Syntax\n      2. URI scheme\n      3. Max-Forwards\n      4. (Optional) Loop Detection\n      5. Proxy-Require\n      6. Proxy-Authorization\n   If any of these checks fail, the element MUST behave as a user agent\n   server (see Section 8.2) and respond with an error code. Notice that a proxy is not required to detect merged requests and\n   MUST NOT treat merged requests as an error condition. The endpoints\n   receiving the requests will resolve the merge as described in Section\n   8.2.2.2. 1. Reasonable syntax check\n      The request MUST be well-formed enough to be handled with a server\n      transaction. Any components involved in the remainder of these\n      Request Validation steps or the Request Forwarding section MUST be\n      well-formed. Any other components, well-formed or not, SHOULD be\n      ignored and remain unchanged when the message is forwarded. For\n      instance, an element would not reject a request because of a\n      malformed Date header field.", "132": "Likewise, a proxy would not remove a\n      malformed Date header field before forwarding a request. This protocol is designed to be extended. Future extensions may\n      define new methods and header fields at any time. An element MUST\n      NOT refuse to proxy a request because it contains a method or\n      header field it does not know about. 2. URI scheme check\n      If the Request-URI has a URI whose scheme is not understood by the\n      proxy, the proxy SHOULD reject the request with a 416 (Unsupported\n      URI Scheme) response. 3. Max-Forwards check\n      The Max-Forwards header field (Section 20.22) is used to limit the\n      number of elements a SIP request can traverse. If the request does not contain a Max-Forwards header field, this\n      check is passed. If the request contains a Max-Forwards header field with a field\n      value greater than zero, the check is passed.", "133": "If the request contains a Max-Forwards header field with a field\n      value of zero (0), the element MUST NOT forward the request. If\n      the request was for OPTIONS, the element MAY act as the final\n      recipient and respond per Section 11. Otherwise, the element MUST\n      return a 483 (Too many hops) response. 4. Optional Loop Detection check\n      An element MAY check for forwarding loops before forwarding a\n      request. If the request contains a Via header field with a sent-\n      by value that equals a value placed into previous requests by the\n      proxy, the request has been forwarded by this element before. The\n      request has either looped or is legitimately spiraling through the\n      element. To determine if the request has looped, the element MAY\n      perform the branch parameter calculation described in Step 8 of\n      Section 16.6 on this message and compare it to the parameter\n      received in that Via header field.", "134": "Full details on session modification are in Section\n   14. At the end of the call, Bob disconnects (hangs up) first and\n   generates a BYE message. This BYE is routed directly to Alice\u2019s\n   softphone, again bypassing the proxies. Alice confirms receipt of\n   the BYE with a 200 (OK) response, which terminates the session and\n   the BYE transaction. No ACK is sent - an ACK is only sent in\n   response to a response to an INVITE request. The reasons for this\n   special handling for INVITE will be discussed later, but relate to\n   the reliability mechanisms in SIP, the length of time it can take for\n   a ringing phone to be answered, and forking. For this reason,\n   request handling in SIP is often classified as either INVITE or non-\n   INVITE, referring to all other methods besides INVITE. Full details\n   on session termination are in Section 15. Section 24.2 describes the messages shown in Figure 1 in full.", "135": "If the parameters match, the\n      request has looped. If they differ, the request is spiraling, and\n      processing continues. If a loop is detected, the element MAY\n      return a 482 (Loop Detected) response. 5. Proxy-Require check\n      Future extensions to this protocol may introduce features that\n      require special handling by proxies. Endpoints will include a\n      Proxy-Require header field in requests that use these features,\n      telling the proxy not to process the request unless the feature is\n      understood. If the request contains a Proxy-Require header field (Section\n      20.29) with one or more option-tags this element does not\n      understand, the element MUST return a 420 (Bad Extension)\n      response. The response MUST include an Unsupported (Section\n      20.40) header field listing those option-tags the element did not\n      understand. 6.", "136": "Proxy-Authorization check\n      If an element requires credentials before forwarding a request,\n      the request MUST be inspected as described in Section 22.3. That\n      section also defines what the element must do if the inspection\n      fails. 16.4 Route Information Preprocessing\n   The proxy MUST inspect the Request-URI of the request. If the\n   Request-URI of the request contains a value this proxy previously\n   placed into a Record-Route header field (see Section 16.6 item 4),\n   the proxy MUST replace the Request-URI in the request with the last\n   value from the Route header field, and remove that value from the\n   Route header field. The proxy MUST then proceed as if it received\n   this modified request. This will only happen when the element sending the request to the\n      proxy (which may have been an endpoint) is a strict router. This\n      rewrite on receive is necessary to enable backwards compatibility\n      with those elements.", "137": "It also allows elements following this\n      specification to preserve the Request-URI through strict-routing\n      proxies (see Section 12.2.1.1). This requirement does not obligate a proxy to keep state in order\n      to detect URIs it previously placed in Record-Route header fields. Instead, a proxy need only place enough information in those URIs\n      to recognize them as values it provided when they later appear. If the Request-URI contains a maddr parameter, the proxy MUST check\n   to see if its value is in the set of addresses or domains the proxy\n   is configured to be responsible for. If the Request-URI has a maddr\n   parameter with a value the proxy is responsible for, and the request\n   was received using the port and transport indicated (explicitly or by\n   default) in the Request-URI, the proxy MUST strip the maddr and any\n   non-default port or transport parameter and continue processing as if\n   those values had not been present in the request.", "138": "A request may arrive with a maddr matching the proxy, but on a\n      port or transport different from that indicated in the URI. Such\n      a request needs to be forwarded to the proxy using the indicated\n      port and transport. If the first value in the Route header field indicates this proxy,\n   the proxy MUST remove that value from the request. 16.5 Determining Request Targets\n   Next, the proxy calculates the target(s) of the request. The set of\n   targets will either be predetermined by the contents of the request\n   or will be obtained from an abstract location service. Each target\n   in the set is represented as a URI. If the Request-URI of the request contains an maddr parameter, the\n   Request-URI MUST be placed into the target set as the only target\n   URI, and the proxy MUST proceed to Section 16.6.", "139": "If the domain of the Request-URI indicates a domain this element is\n   not responsible for, the Request-URI MUST be placed into the target\n   set as the only target, and the element MUST proceed to the task of\n   Request Forwarding (Section 16.6). There are many circumstances in which a proxy might receive a\n      request for a domain it is not responsible for. A firewall proxy\n      handling outgoing calls (the way HTTP proxies handle outgoing\n      requests) is an example of where this is likely to occur. If the target set for the request has not been predetermined as\n   described above, this implies that the element is responsible for the\n   domain in the Request-URI, and the element MAY use whatever mechanism\n   it desires to determine where to send the request. Any of these\n   mechanisms can be modeled as accessing an abstract Location Service.", "140": "This may consist of obtaining information from a location service\n   created by a SIP Registrar, reading a database, consulting a presence\n   server, utilizing other protocols, or simply performing an\n   algorithmic substitution on the Request-URI. When accessing the\n   location service constructed by a registrar, the Request-URI MUST\n   first be canonicalized as described in Section 10.3 before being used\n   as an index. The output of these mechanisms is used to construct the\n   target set. If the Request-URI does not provide sufficient information for the\n   proxy to determine the target set, it SHOULD return a 485 (Ambiguous)\n   response. This response SHOULD contain a Contact header field\n   containing URIs of new addresses to be tried. For example, an INVITE    to sip:John.Smith@company.com may be ambiguous at a proxy whose\n   location service has multiple John Smiths listed. See Section\n   21.4.23 for details.", "141": "Any information in or about the request or the current environment of\n   the element MAY be used in the construction of the target set. For\n   instance, different sets may be constructed depending on contents or\n   the presence of header fields and bodies, the time of day of the\n   request\u2019s arrival, the interface on which the request arrived,\n   failure of previous requests, or even the element\u2019s current level of\n   utilization. As potential targets are located through these services, their URIs\n   are added to the target set. Targets can only be placed in the\n   target set once. If a target URI is already present in the set\n   (based on the definition of equality for the URI type), it MUST NOT\n   be added again. A proxy MUST NOT add additional targets to the target set if the\n   Request-URI of the original request does not indicate a resource this\n   proxy is responsible for. A proxy can only change the Request-URI of a request during\n      forwarding if it is responsible for that URI.", "142": "If the proxy is not\n      responsible for that URI, it will not recurse on 3xx or 416\n      responses as described below. If the Request-URI of the original request indicates a resource this\n   proxy is responsible for, the proxy MAY continue to add targets to\n   the set after beginning Request Forwarding. It MAY use any\n   information obtained during that processing to determine new targets. For instance, a proxy may choose to incorporate contacts obtained in\n   a redirect response (3xx) into the target set. If a proxy uses a\n   dynamic source of information while building the target set (for\n   instance, if it consults a SIP Registrar), it SHOULD monitor that\n   source for the duration of processing the request. New locations\n   SHOULD be added to the target set as they become available.

For example, a trivial location service is a \"no-op\", where the\n   target URI is equal to the incoming request URI. The request is sent\n   to a specific next hop proxy for further processing. During request    forwarding of Section 16.6, Item 6, the identity of that next hop,\n   expressed as a SIP or SIPS URI, is inserted as the top-most Route\n   header field value into the request. If the Request-URI indicates a resource at this proxy that does not\n   exist, the proxy MUST return a 404 (Not Found) response. If the target set remains empty after applying all of the above, the\n   proxy MUST return an error response, which SHOULD be the 480\n   (Temporarily Unavailable) response. 16.6 Request Forwarding\n   As soon as the target set is non-empty, a proxy MAY begin forwarding\n   the request.", "144": "A stateful proxy MAY process the set in any order.

A common ordering mechanism is to use the qvalue parameter of targets\n   obtained from Contact header fields (see Section 20.10). Targets are\n   processed from highest qvalue to lowest. Targets with equal qvalues\n   may be processed in parallel. A stateful proxy must have a mechanism to maintain the target set as\n   responses are received and associate the responses to each forwarded\n   request with the original request. For the purposes of this model,\n   this mechanism is a \"response context\" created by the proxy layer\n   before forwarding the first request.", "145": "In some cases, it may be useful for proxies in the SIP signaling path\n   to see all the messaging between the endpoints for the duration of\n   the session.

This information would be received by both Bob\u2019s SIP\n   phone and (due to the Record-Route header field being passed back in\n   the 200 (OK)) Alice\u2019s softphone and stored for the duration of the\n   dialog. The biloxi.com proxy server would then receive and proxy the\n   ACK, BYE, and 200 (OK) to the BYE.

Item 8 of\n         Section 16.7 recommends a mechanism to make the URI\n         sufficiently distinct.

Postprocess routing information\n         A proxy MAY have a local policy that mandates that a request\n         visit a specific set of proxies before being delivered to the\n         destination.

This set of proxies is represented by a set of URIs\n         (each of which contains the lr parameter). This set MUST be\n         pushed into the Route header field of the copy ahead of any\n         existing values, if present.

The REGISTER messages associate Bob\u2019s SIP or SIPS URI\n   (sip:bob@biloxi.com) with the machine into which he is currently\n   logged (conveyed as a SIP or SIPS URI in the Contact header field). The registrar writes this association, also called a binding, to a\n   database, called the location service, where it can be used by the\n   proxy in the biloxi.com domain. Often, a registrar server for a\n   domain is co-located with the proxy for that domain. It is an\n   important concept that the distinction between types of SIP servers\n   is logical, not physical. Bob is not limited to registering from a single device.", "157": "If the proxy has a local policy that mandates that the request\n         visit one specific proxy, an alternative to pushing a Route\n         value into the Route header field is to bypass the forwarding\n         logic of item 10 below, and instead just send the request to\n         the address, port, and transport for that specific proxy. If\n         the request has a Route header field, this alternative MUST NOT\n         be used unless it is known that next hop proxy is a loose\n         router. Otherwise, this approach MAY be used, but the Route\n         insertion mechanism above is preferred for its robustness,\n         flexibility, generality and consistency of operation. Furthermore, if the Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, TLS MUST\n         be used to communicate with that proxy. If the copy contains a Route header field, the proxy MUST\n         inspect the URI in its first value.", "158": "If that URI does not\n         contain an lr parameter, the proxy MUST modify the copy as\n         follows:\n         -  The proxy MUST place the Request-URI into the Route header\n            field as the last value. -  The proxy MUST then place the first Route header field value\n            into the Request-URI and remove that value from the Route\n            header field. Appending the Request-URI to the Route header field is part of\n         a mechanism used to pass the information in that Request-URI\n         through strict-routing elements. \"Popping\" the first Route\n         header field value into the Request-URI formats the message the\n         way a strict-routing element expects to receive it (with its\n         own URI in the Request-URI and the next location to visit in\n         the first Route header field value). 7.", "159": "Determine Next-Hop Address, Port, and Transport\n         The proxy MAY have a local policy to send the request to a\n         specific IP address, port, and transport, independent of the\n         values of the Route and Request-URI. Such a policy MUST NOT be\n         used if the proxy is not certain that the IP address, port, and\n         transport correspond to a server that is a loose router. However, this mechanism for sending the request through a\n         specific next hop is NOT RECOMMENDED; instead a Route header\n         field should be used for that purpose as described above. In the absence of such an overriding mechanism, the proxy\n         applies the procedures listed in [4] as follows to determine\n         where to send the request. If the proxy has reformatted the\n         request to send to a strict-routing element as described in\n         step 6 above, the proxy MUST apply those procedures to the\n         Request-URI of the request.", "160": "Otherwise, the proxy MUST apply\n         the procedures to the first value in the Route header field, if\n         present, else the Request-URI. The procedures will produce an\n         ordered set of (address, port, transport) tuples. Independently of which URI is being used as input to the\n         procedures of [4], if the Request-URI specifies a SIPS\n         resource, the proxy MUST follow the procedures of [4] as if the\n         input URI were a SIPS URI. As described in [4], the proxy MUST attempt to deliver the\n         message to the first tuple in that set, and proceed through the\n         set in order until the delivery attempt succeeds. For each tuple attempted, the proxy MUST format the message as\n         appropriate for the tuple and send the request using a new\n         client transaction as detailed in steps 8 through 10. Since each attempt uses a new client transaction, it represents\n         a new branch.", "161": "Thus, the branch parameter provided with the Via\n         header field inserted in step 8 MUST be different for each\n         attempt. If the client transaction reports failure to send the request\n         or a timeout from its state machine, the proxy continues to the\n         next address in that ordered set. If the ordered set is\n         exhausted, the request cannot be forwarded to this element in\n         the target set. The proxy does not need to place anything in\n         the response context, but otherwise acts as if this element of\n         the target set returned a 408 (Request Timeout) final response. 8. Add a Via header field value\n         The proxy MUST insert a Via header field value into the copy\n         before the existing Via header field values. The construction\n         of this value follows the same guidelines of Section 8.1.1.7.", "162": "This implies that the proxy will compute its own branch\n         parameter, which will be globally unique for that branch, and\n         contain the requisite magic cookie. Note that this implies that\n         the branch parameter will be different for different instances\n         of a spiraled or looped request through a proxy. Proxies choosing to detect loops have an additional constraint\n         in the value they use for construction of the branch parameter. A proxy choosing to detect loops SHOULD create a branch\n         parameter separable into two parts by the implementation. The\n         first part MUST satisfy the constraints of Section 8.1.1.7 as\n         described above. The second is used to perform loop detection\n         and distinguish loops from spirals. Loop detection is performed by verifying that, when a request\n         returns to a proxy, those fields having an impact on the\n         processing of the request have not changed.", "163": "The value placed\n         in this part of the branch parameter SHOULD reflect all of\n         those fields (including any Route, Proxy-Require and Proxy-\n         Authorization header fields).

A common way to create this value is to compute a\n         cryptographic hash of the To tag, From tag, Call-ID header\n         field, the Request-URI of the request received (before\n         translation), the topmost Via header, and the sequence number\n         from the CSeq header field, in addition to any Proxy-Require\n         and Proxy-Authorization header fields that may be present. The          algorithm used to compute the hash is implementation-dependent,\n         but MD5 (RFC 1321 [35]), expressed in hexadecimal, is a\n         reasonable choice.

This is\n         necessary to distinguish looped requests from requests whose\n         routing parameters have changed before returning to this\n         server. The request method MUST NOT be included in the calculation of\n         the branch parameter. In particular, CANCEL and ACK requests\n         (for non-2xx responses) MUST have the same branch value as the\n         corresponding request they cancel or acknowledge.

Forward Request\n         A stateful proxy MUST create a new client transaction for this\n         request as described in Section 17.1 and instructs the\n         transaction to send the request using the address, port and\n         transport determined in step 7. 11. Set timer C\n         In order to handle the case where an INVITE request never\n         generates a final response, the TU uses a timer which is called\n         timer C.

If none\n   is found, the element MUST process the response (even if it is an\n   informational response) as a stateless proxy (described below). If a\n   match is found, the response is handed to the client transaction. Forwarding responses for which a client transaction (or more\n      generally any knowledge of having sent an associated request) is\n      not found improves robustness. In particular, it ensures that\n      \"late\" 2xx responses to INVITE requests are forwarded properly.

This is because retransmissions of a request\n         need to have the same value, and a stateless proxy cannot tell\n         a retransmission from the original request.

One of\n         these fields will always vary across two different\n         transactions. o  All other message transformations specified in Section 16.6\n         MUST result in the same transformation of a retransmitted\n         request.", "196": "In particular, if the proxy inserts a Record-Route\n         value or pushes URIs into the Route header field, it MUST place\n         the same values in retransmissions of the request.

The\n         request is sent directly to the transport layer instead of\n         through a client transaction. Since a stateless proxy must forward retransmitted requests to\n         the same destination and add identical branch parameters to\n         each of them, it can only use information from the message\n         itself and time-invariant configuration data for those\n         calculations.", "197": "If the configuration state is not time-invariant\n         (for example, if a routing table is updated) any requests that\n         could be affected by the change may not be forwarded\n         statelessly during an interval equal to the transaction timeout\n         window before or after the change. The method of processing\n         the affected requests in that interval is an implementation\n         decision. A common solution is to forward them transaction\n         statefully. Stateless proxies MUST NOT perform special processing for CANCEL\n   requests. They are processed by the above rules as any other\n   requests. In particular, a stateless proxy applies the same Route\n   header field processing to CANCEL requests that it applies to any\n   other request. Response processing as described in Section 16.7 does not apply to a\n   proxy behaving statelessly. When a response arrives at a stateless\n   proxy, the proxy MUST inspect the sent-by value in the first\n   (topmost) Via header field value.", "198": "If that address matches the proxy,\n   (it equals a value this proxy has inserted into previous requests)\n   the proxy MUST remove that header field value from the response and\n   forward the result to the location indicated in the next Via header\n   field value.

The proxy will inspect the Request-URI. If it indicates a\n          resource owned by this proxy, the proxy will replace it with\n          the results of running a location service. Otherwise, the\n          proxy will not change the Request-URI. 2.", "199": "The proxy will inspect the URI in the topmost Route header\n          field value. If it indicates this proxy, the proxy removes it\n          from the Route header field (this route node has been\n          reached). 3. The proxy will forward the request to the resource indicated\n          by the URI in the topmost Route header field value or in the\n          Request-URI if no Route header field is present. The proxy\n          determines the address, port and transport to use when\n          forwarding the request by applying the procedures in [4] to\n          that URI.

The reason for this separation is rooted in the importance of\n      delivering all 200 (OK) responses to an INVITE to the UAC. To\n      deliver them all to the UAC, the UAS alone takes responsibility       for retransmitting them (see Section 13.3.1.4), and the UAC alone\n      takes responsibility for acknowledging them with ACK (see Section\n      13.2.2.4).

A TU that creates a client transaction can also cancel it. When a client cancels a transaction, it requests that the server stop\n   further processing, revert to the state that existed before the\n   transaction was initiated, and generate a specific error response to\n   that transaction. This is done with a CANCEL request, which\n   constitutes its own transaction, but references the transaction to be\n   cancelled (Section 9).

Nearly all of the transaction timers\n   described here scale with T1, and changing T1 adjusts their values. The request is not retransmitted over reliable transports. After\n   receiving a 1xx response, any retransmissions cease altogether, and\n   the client waits for further responses. The server transaction can\n   send additional 1xx responses, which are not transmitted reliably by\n   the server transaction. Eventually, the server transaction decides\n   to send a final response. For unreliable transports, that response\n   is retransmitted periodically, and for reliable transports, it is\n   sent once. For each final response that is received at the client\n   transaction, the client transaction sends an ACK, the purpose of\n   which is to quench retransmissions of the response. 17.1.1.2 Formal Description\n   The state machine for the INVITE client transaction is shown in\n   Figure 5.", "218": "The initial state, \"calling\", MUST be entered when the TU\n   initiates a new client transaction with an INVITE request.

The reason is that 2xx responses to an INVITE are treated\n   differently; each one is forwarded by proxies, and the ACK handling\n   in a UAC is different.

A UAC core that generates an ACK for 2xx\n   MUST instead follow the rules described in Section 13. The ACK request constructed by the client transaction MUST contain\n   values for the Call-ID, From, and Request-URI that are equal to the\n   values of those header fields in the request passed to the transport\n   by the client transaction (call this the \"original request\").", "230": "The To\n   header field in the ACK MUST equal the To header field in the\n   response being acknowledged, and therefore will usually differ from\n   the To header field in the original request by the addition of the\n   tag parameter.

The CSeq header field in the ACK MUST contain the same\n   value for the sequence number as was present in the original request,\n   but the method parameter MUST be equal to \"ACK\". If the INVITE request whose response is being acknowledged had Route\n   header fields, those header fields MUST appear in the ACK. This is\n   to ensure that the ACK can be routed properly through any downstream\n   stateless proxies. Although any request MAY contain a body, a body in an ACK is special\n   since the request cannot be rejected if the body is not understood.", "231": "Therefore, placement of bodies in ACK for non-2xx is NOT RECOMMENDED,\n   but if done, the body types are restricted to any that appeared in\n   the INVITE, assuming that the response to the INVITE was not 415.

They are simple\n   request-response interactions. For unreliable transports, requests\n   are retransmitted at an interval which starts at T1 and doubles until\n   it hits T2.", "233": "If a provisional response is received, retransmissions\n   continue for unreliable transports, but at an interval of T2. The\n   server transaction retransmits the last response it sent, which can\n   be a provisional or final response, only when a retransmission of the\n   request is received. This is why request retransmissions need to\n   continue even after a provisional response; they are to ensure\n   reliable delivery of the final response. Unlike an INVITE transaction, a non-INVITE transaction has no special\n   handling for the 2xx response. The result is that only a single 2xx\n   response to a non-INVITE is ever delivered to a UAC. 17.1.2.2 Formal Description\n   The state machine for the non-INVITE client transaction is shown in\n   Figure 6. It is very similar to the state machine for INVITE. The \"Trying\" state is entered when the TU initiates a new client\n   transaction with a request. When entering this state, the client\n   transaction SHOULD set timer F to fire in 64*T1 seconds.", "234": "When a UAC sends a request that is within the context of a\n   dialog, it follows the common UAC rules as discussed in Section 8 but\n   also the rules for mid-dialog requests. Section 12 discusses dialogs\n   and presents the procedures for their construction and maintenance,\n   in addition to construction of requests within a dialog. The most important method in SIP is the INVITE method, which is used\n   to establish a session between participants. A session is a\n   collection of participants, and streams of media between them, for\n   the purposes of communication. Section 13 discusses how sessions are\n   initiated, resulting in one or more SIP dialogs. Section 14\n   discusses how characteristics of that session are modified through\n   the use of an INVITE request within a dialog. Finally, section 15\n   discusses how a session is terminated.", "235": "The request\n   MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission. If an\n   unreliable transport is in use, the client transaction MUST set timer\n   E to fire in T1 seconds. If timer E fires while still in this state,\n   the timer is reset, but this time with a value of MIN(2*T1, T2). When the timer fires again, it is reset to a MIN(4*T1, T2). This\n   process continues so that retransmissions occur with an exponentially\n   increasing interval that caps at T2. The default value of T2 is 4s,\n   and it represents the amount of time a non-INVITE server transaction\n   will take to respond to a request, if it does not respond\n   immediately. For the default values of T1 and T2, this results in\n   intervals of 500 ms, 1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 4 s, 4 s, etc. If Timer F fires while the client transaction is still in the\n   \"Trying\" state, the client transaction SHOULD inform the TU about the\n   timeout, and then it SHOULD enter the \"Terminated\" state.", "236": "If a\n   provisional response is received while in the \"Trying\" state, the\n   response MUST be passed to the TU, and then the client transaction\n   SHOULD move to the \"Proceeding\" state.

If Timer E fires while in the \"Proceeding\" state, the request MUST be\n   passed to the transport layer for retransmission, and Timer E MUST be\n   reset with a value of T2 seconds.

T4 represents the amount of time the network\n   will take to clear messages between client and server transactions. The default value of T4 is 5s. A response is a retransmission when\n   it matches the same transaction, using the rules specified in Section\n   17.1.3.

The\n   branch parameter in the top Via header field is used for this\n   purpose. A response matches a client transaction under two\n   conditions:\n      1. If the response has the same value of the branch parameter in\n          the top Via header field as the branch parameter in the top\n          Via header field of the request that created the transaction. 2. If the method parameter in the CSeq header field matches the\n          method of the request that created the transaction.

It accomplishes\n   this through a state machine. Server transactions are created by the\n   core when a request is received, and transaction handling is desired\n   for that request (this is not always the case). As with the client transactions, the state machine depends on whether\n   the received request is an INVITE request. 17.2.1 INVITE Server Transaction\n   The state diagram for the INVITE server transaction is shown in\n   Figure 7.

The 100 (Trying) response is constructed\n   according to the procedures in Section 8.2.6, except that the\n   insertion of tags in the To header field of the response (when none\n   was present in the request) is downgraded from MAY to SHOULD NOT. The request MUST be passed to the TU. The TU passes any number of provisional responses to the server\n   transaction. So long as the server transaction is in the\n   \"Proceeding\" state, each of these MUST be passed to the transport\n   layer for transmission. They are not sent reliably by the\n   transaction layer (they are not retransmitted by it) and do not cause\n   a change in the state of the server transaction.", "245": "The procedures of Sections 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 deal\n   entirely with the UA core (Section 9 describes cancellation, which\n   applies to both UA core and proxy core).

Address-of-Record: An address-of-record (AOR) is a SIP or SIPS URI\n         that points to a domain with a location service that can map\n         the URI to another URI where the user might be available. Typically, the location service is populated through\n         registrations. An AOR is frequently thought of as the \"public\n         address\" of the user. Back-to-Back User Agent: A back-to-back user agent (B2BUA) is a\n         logical entity that receives a request and processes it as a\n         user agent server (UAS).", "246": "If a request\n   retransmission is received while in the \"Proceeding\" state, the most\n   recent provisional response that was received from the TU MUST be\n   passed to the transport layer for retransmission.

If, while in the \"Proceeding\" state, the TU passes a 2xx response to\n   the server transaction, the server transaction MUST pass this\n   response to the transport layer for transmission. It is not    retransmitted by the server transaction; retransmissions of 2xx\n   responses are handled by the TU. The server transaction MUST then\n   transition to the \"Terminated\" state. While in the \"Proceeding\" state, if the TU passes a response with\n   status code from 300 to 699 to the server transaction, the response\n   MUST be passed to the transport layer for transmission, and the state\n   machine MUST enter the \"Completed\" state.", "247": "For unreliable transports,\n   timer G is set to fire in T1 seconds, and is not set to fire for\n   reliable transports.

Its value is\n   chosen to equal Timer B, the amount of time a client transaction will\n   continue to retry sending a request. If timer G fires, the response\n   is passed to the transport layer once more for retransmission, and\n   timer G is set to fire in MIN(2*T1, T2) seconds. From then on, when\n   timer G fires, the response is passed to the transport again for\n   transmission, and timer G is reset with a value that doubles, unless\n   that value exceeds T2, in which case it is reset with the value of\n   T2.", "248": "This is identical to the retransmit behavior for requests in the\n   \"Trying\" state of the non-INVITE client transaction.

This is accomplished in the\n   following manner. The branch parameter in the topmost Via header field of the request\n   is examined.

This matching rule applies to both INVITE and non-INVITE transactions\n   alike. The sent-by value is used as part of the matching process because\n      there could be accidental or malicious duplication of branch\n      parameters from different clients.", "255": "If the branch parameter in the top Via header field is not present,\n   or does not contain the magic cookie, the following procedures are\n   used. These exist to handle backwards compatibility with RFC 2543\n   compliant implementations. The INVITE request matches a transaction if the Request-URI, To tag,\n   From tag, Call-ID, CSeq, and top Via header field match those of the\n   INVITE request which created the transaction. In this case, the\n   INVITE is a retransmission of the original one that created the\n   transaction. The ACK request matches a transaction if the Request-\n   URI, From tag, Call-ID, CSeq number (not the method), and top Via\n   header field match those of the INVITE request which created the\n   transaction, and the To tag of the ACK matches the To tag of the\n   response sent by the server transaction.

First, the procedures in [4] are followed, which attempt to deliver\n   the response to a backup. If those should all fail, based on the\n   definition of failure in [4], the server transaction SHOULD inform\n   the TU that a failure has occurred, and SHOULD transition to the\n   terminated state.", "260": "18 Transport\n   The transport layer is responsible for the actual transmission of\n   requests and responses over network transports. This includes\n   determination of the connection to use for a request or response in\n   the case of connection-oriented transports. The transport layer is responsible for managing persistent\n   connections for transport protocols like TCP and SCTP, or TLS over\n   those, including ones opened to the transport layer. This includes\n   connections opened by the client or server transports, so that\n   connections are shared between client and server transport functions. These connections are indexed by the tuple formed from the address,\n   port, and transport protocol at the far end of the connection. When\n   a connection is opened by the transport layer, this index is set to\n   the destination IP, port and transport. When the connection is\n   accepted by the transport layer, this index is set to the source IP\n   address, port number, and transport.", "261": "Note that, because the source\n   port is often ephemeral, but it cannot be known whether it is\n   ephemeral or selected through procedures in [4], connections accepted\n   by the transport layer will frequently not be reused. The result is\n   that two proxies in a \"peering\" relationship using a connection-\n   oriented transport frequently will have two connections in use, one\n   for transactions initiated in each direction. It is RECOMMENDED that connections be kept open for some\n   implementation-defined duration after the last message was sent or\n   received over that connection. This duration SHOULD at least equal\n   the longest amount of time the element would need in order to bring a\n   transaction from instantiation to the terminated state. This is to\n   make it likely that transactions are completed over the same\n   connection on which they are initiated (for example, request,\n   response, and in the case of INVITE, ACK for non-2xx responses).", "262": "This usually means at least 64*T1 (see Section 17.1.1.1 for a\n   definition of T1). However, it could be larger in an element that\n   has a TU using a large value for timer C (bullet 11 of Section 16.6),\n   for example. All SIP elements MUST implement UDP and TCP. SIP elements MAY\n   implement other protocols. Making TCP mandatory for the UA is a substantial change from RFC\n      2543. It has arisen out of the need to handle larger messages,\n      which MUST use TCP, as discussed below. Thus, even if an element\n      never sends large messages, it may receive one and needs to be\n      able to handle them. 18.1 Clients\n18.1.1 Sending Requests\n   The client side of the transport layer is responsible for sending the\n   request and receiving responses. The user of the transport layer\n   passes the client transport the request, an IP address, port,\n   transport, and possibly TTL for multicast destinations.", "263": "If a request is within 200 bytes of the path MTU, or if it is larger\n   than 1300 bytes and the path MTU is unknown, the request MUST be sent\n   using an RFC 2914 [43] congestion controlled transport protocol, such\n   as TCP. If this causes a change in the transport protocol from the\n   one indicated in the top Via, the value in the top Via MUST be\n   changed. This prevents fragmentation of messages over UDP and\n   provides congestion control for larger messages. However,\n   implementations MUST be able to handle messages up to the maximum\n   datagram packet size. For UDP, this size is 65,535 bytes, including\n   IP and UDP headers. The 200 byte \"buffer\" between the message size and the MTU\n      accommodates the fact that the response in SIP can be larger than\n      the request. This happens due to the addition of Record-Route\n      header field values to the responses to INVITE, for example.", "264": "With\n      the extra buffer, the response can be about 170 bytes larger than\n      the request, and still not be fragmented on IPv4 (about 30 bytes       is consumed by IP/UDP, assuming no IPSec). 1300 is chosen when\n      path MTU is not known, based on the assumption of a 1500 byte\n      Ethernet MTU. If an element sends a request over TCP because of these message size\n   constraints, and that request would have otherwise been sent over\n   UDP, if the attempt to establish the connection generates either an\n   ICMP Protocol Not Supported, or results in a TCP reset, the element\n   SHOULD retry the request, using UDP. This is only to provide\n   backwards compatibility with RFC 2543 compliant implementations that\n   do not support TCP. It is anticipated that this behavior will be\n   deprecated in a future revision of this specification.", "265": "A client that sends a request to a multicast address MUST add the\n   \"maddr\" parameter to its Via header field value containing the\n   destination multicast address, and for IPv4, SHOULD add the \"ttl\"\n   parameter with a value of 1. Usage of IPv6 multicast is not defined\n   in this specification, and will be a subject of future\n   standardization when the need arises. These rules result in a purposeful limitation of multicast in SIP. Its primary function is to provide a \"single-hop-discovery-like\"\n   service, delivering a request to a group of homogeneous servers,\n   where it is only required to process the response from any one of\n   them. This functionality is most useful for registrations. In fact,\n   based on the transaction processing rules in Section 17.1.3, the\n   client transaction will accept the first response, and view any\n   others as retransmissions because they all contain the same Via\n   branch identifier.", "266": "Before a request is sent, the client transport MUST insert a value of\n   the \"sent-by\" field into the Via header field.

If the port is absent, the default\n   value depends on the transport. It is 5060 for UDP, TCP and SCTP,\n   5061 for TLS. For reliable transports, the response is normally sent on the\n   connection on which the request was received. Therefore, the client\n   transport MUST be prepared to receive the response on the same\n   connection used to send the request. Under error conditions, the\n   server may attempt to open a new connection to send the response. To\n   handle this case, the transport layer MUST also be prepared to\n   receive an incoming connection on the source IP address from which\n   the request was sent and port number in the \"sent-by\" field.", "267": "Clients may or may not interact\n         directly with a human user.

Handling of\n   these \"stray\" responses is dependent on the core (a proxy will\n   forward them, while a UA will discard, for example). 18.2 Servers\n18.2.1 Receiving Requests\n   A server SHOULD be prepared to receive requests on any IP address,\n   port and transport combination that can be the result of a DNS lookup\n   on a SIP or SIPS URI [4] that is handed out for the purposes of\n   communicating with that server. In this context, \"handing out\"\n   includes placing a URI in a Contact header field in a REGISTER\n   request or a redirect response, or in a Record-Route header field in\n   a request or response. A URI can also be \"handed out\" by placing it\n   on a web page or business card.", "271": "It is also RECOMMENDED that a server\n   listen for requests on the default SIP ports (5060 for TCP and UDP,\n   5061 for TLS over TCP) on all public interfaces. The typical\n   exception would be private networks, or when multiple server\n   instances are running on the same host. For any port and interface\n   that a server listens on for UDP, it MUST listen on that same port\n   and interface for TCP. This is because a message may need to be sent\n   using TCP, rather than UDP, if it is too large. As a result, the\n   converse is not true. A server need not listen for UDP on a\n   particular address and port just because it is listening on that same\n   address and port for TCP. There may, of course, be other reasons why\n   a server needs to listen for UDP on a particular address and port. When the server transport receives a request over any transport, it\n   MUST examine the value of the \"sent-by\" parameter in the top Via\n   header field value.", "272": "If the host portion of the \"sent-by\" parameter\n   contains a domain name, or if it contains an IP address that differs\n   from the packet source address, the server MUST add a \"received\"\n   parameter to that Via header field value. This parameter MUST\n   contain the source address from which the packet was received. This\n   is to assist the server transport layer in sending the response,\n   since it must be sent to the source IP address from which the request\n   came. Consider a request received by the server transport which looks like,\n   in part:\n      INVITE sip:bob@Biloxi.com SIP/2.0\n      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060\n   The request is received with a source IP address of 192.0.2.4.", "273": "Before passing the request up, the transport adds a \"received\"\n   parameter, so that the request would look like, in part:\n      INVITE sip:bob@Biloxi.com SIP/2.0\n      Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bobspc.biloxi.com:5060;received=192.0.2.4\n   Next, the server transport attempts to match the request to a server\n   transaction. It does so using the matching rules described in\n   Section 17.2.3. If a matching server transaction is found, the\n   request is passed to that transaction for processing. If no match is\n   found, the request is passed to the core, which may decide to\n   construct a new server transaction for that request. Note that when\n   a UAS core sends a 2xx response to INVITE, the server transaction is\n   destroyed. This means that when the ACK arrives, there will be no\n   matching server transaction, and based on this rule, the ACK is\n   passed to the UAS core, where it is processed.", "274": "18.2.2 Sending Responses\n   The server transport uses the value of the top Via header field in\n   order to determine where to send a response. It MUST follow the\n   following process:\n      o  If the \"sent-protocol\" is a reliable transport protocol such as\n         TCP or SCTP, or TLS over those, the response MUST be sent using\n         the existing connection to the source of the original request\n         that created the transaction, if that connection is still open. This requires the server transport to maintain an association\n         between server transactions and transport connections. If that\n         connection is no longer open, the server SHOULD open a\n         connection to the IP address in the \"received\" parameter, if\n         present, using the port in the \"sent-by\" value, or the default\n         port for that transport, if no port is specified.", "275": "If that\n         connection attempt fails, the server SHOULD use the procedures\n         in [4] for servers in order to determine the IP address and\n         port to open the connection and send the response to. o  Otherwise, if the Via header field value contains a \"maddr\"\n         parameter, the response MUST be forwarded to the address listed\n         there, using the port indicated in \"sent-by\", or port 5060 if\n         none is present. If the address is a multicast address, the\n         response SHOULD be sent using the TTL indicated in the \"ttl\"\n         parameter, or with a TTL of 1 if that parameter is not present. o  Otherwise (for unreliable unicast transports), if the top Via\n         has a \"received\" parameter, the response MUST be sent to the\n         address in the \"received\" parameter, using the port indicated\n         in the \"sent-by\" value, or using port 5060 if none is specified\n         explicitly.", "276": "If this fails, for example, elicits an ICMP \"port\n         unreachable\" response, the procedures of Section 5 of [4]\n         SHOULD be used to determine where to send the response. o  Otherwise, if it is not receiver-tagged, the response MUST be\n         sent to the address indicated by the \"sent-by\" value, using the\n         procedures in Section 5 of [4]. 18.3 Framing\n   In the case of message-oriented transports (such as UDP), if the\n   message has a Content-Length header field, the message body is\n   assumed to contain that many bytes. If there are additional bytes in\n   the transport packet beyond the end of the body, they MUST be\n   discarded. If the transport packet ends before the end of the\n   message body, this is considered an error. If the message is a\n   response, it MUST be discarded. If the message is a request, the\n   element SHOULD generate a 400 (Bad Request) response.", "277": "If the message\n   has no Content-Length header field, the message body is assumed to\n   end at the end of the transport packet. In the case of stream-oriented transports such as TCP, the Content-\n   Length header field indicates the size of the body. The Content-\n   Length header field MUST be used with stream oriented transports. 18.4 Error Handling\n   Error handling is independent of whether the message was a request or\n   response. If the transport user asks for a message to be sent over an\n   unreliable transport, and the result is an ICMP error, the behavior\n   depends on the type of ICMP error. Host, network, port or protocol\n   unreachable errors, or parameter problem errors SHOULD cause the\n   transport layer to inform the transport user of a failure in sending. Source quench and TTL exceeded ICMP errors SHOULD be ignored.", "278": "Downstream: A direction of message forwarding within a transaction\n         that refers to the direction that requests flow from the user\n         agent client to user agent server. Final Response: A response that terminates a SIP transaction, as\n         opposed to a provisional response that does not. All 2xx, 3xx,\n         4xx, 5xx and 6xx responses are final. Header: A header is a component of a SIP message that conveys\n         information about the message. It is structured as a sequence\n         of header fields. Header Field: A header field is a component of the SIP message\n         header. A header field can appear as one or more header field\n         rows. Header field rows consist of a header field name and zero\n         or more header field values. Multiple header field values on a          given header field row are separated by commas. Some header\n         fields can only have a single header field value, and as a\n         result, always appear as a single header field row.", "279": "If the transport user asks for a request to be sent over a reliable\n   transport, and the result is a connection failure, the transport\n   layer SHOULD inform the transport user of a failure in sending. 19 Common Message Components\n   There are certain components of SIP messages that appear in various\n   places within SIP messages (and sometimes, outside of them) that\n   merit separate discussion. 19.1 SIP and SIPS Uniform Resource Indicators\n   A SIP or SIPS URI identifies a communications resource. Like all\n   URIs, SIP and SIPS URIs may be placed in web pages, email messages,\n   or printed literature. They contain sufficient information to\n   initiate and maintain a communication session with the resource.", "280": "Examples of communications resources include the following:\n      o  a user of an online service\n      o  an appearance on a multi-line phone\n      o  a mailbox on a messaging system\n      o  a PSTN number at a gateway service\n      o  a group (such as \"sales\" or \"helpdesk\") in an organization\n   A SIPS URI specifies that the resource be contacted securely. This\n   means, in particular, that TLS is to be used between the UAC and the\n   domain that owns the URI. From there, secure communications are used\n   to reach the user, where the specific security mechanism depends on\n   the policy of the domain. Any resource described by a SIP URI can be\n   \"upgraded\" to a SIPS URI by just changing the scheme, if it is\n   desired to communicate with that resource securely. 19.1.1 SIP and SIPS URI Components\n   The \"sip:\" and \"sips:\" schemes follow the guidelines in RFC 2396 [5].", "281": "They use a form similar to the mailto URL, allowing the specification\n   of SIP request-header fields and the SIP message-body. This makes it\n   possible to specify the subject, media type, or urgency of sessions\n   initiated by using a URI on a web page or in an email message. The\n   formal syntax for a SIP or SIPS URI is presented in Section 25. Its\n   general form, in the case of a SIP URI, is:\n      sip:user:password@host:port;uri-parameters?headers\n   The format for a SIPS URI is the same, except that the scheme is\n   \"sips\" instead of sip. These tokens, and some of the tokens in their\n   expansions, have the following meanings:\n      user: The identifier of a particular resource at the host being\n         addressed. The term \"host\" in this context frequently refers\n         to a domain. The \"userinfo\" of a URI consists of this user\n         field, the password field, and the @ sign following them.", "282": "The\n         userinfo part of a URI is optional and MAY be absent when the          destination host does not have a notion of users or when the\n         host itself is the resource being identified. If the @ sign is\n         present in a SIP or SIPS URI, the user field MUST NOT be empty. If the host being addressed can process telephone numbers, for\n         instance, an Internet telephony gateway, a telephone-\n         subscriber field defined in RFC 2806 [9] MAY be used to\n         populate the user field. There are special escaping rules for\n         encoding telephone-subscriber fields in SIP and SIPS URIs\n         described in Section 19.1.2.\n      password: A password associated with the user. While the SIP and\n         SIPS URI syntax allows this field to be present, its use is NOT\n         RECOMMENDED, because the passing of authentication information\n         in clear text (such as URIs) has proven to be a security risk\n         in almost every case where it has been used.", "283": "For instance,\n         transporting a PIN number in this field exposes the PIN.

Parameter names are\n         defined for UDP (RFC 768 [14]), TCP (RFC 761 [15]), and SCTP\n         (RFC 2960 [16]). For a SIPS URI, the transport parameter MUST\n         indicate a reliable transport.

The maddr field has been used as a simple form of loose source\n         routing. It allows a URI to specify a proxy that must be\n         traversed en-route to the destination. Continuing to use the\n         maddr parameter this way is strongly discouraged (the\n         mechanisms that enable it are deprecated).

From RFC 2396 [5]:\n      The set of characters actually reserved within any given URI\n      component is defined by that component. In general, a character\n      is reserved if the semantics of the URI changes if the character\n      is replaced with its escaped US-ASCII encoding [5]. Excluded US-\n      ASCII characters (RFC 2396 [5]), such as space and control\n      characters and characters used as URI delimiters, also MUST be\n      escaped.", "294": "URIs MUST NOT contain unescaped space and control\n      characters. For each component, the set of valid BNF expansions defines exactly\n   which characters may appear unescaped. All other characters MUST be\n   escaped. For example, \"@\" is not in the set of characters in the user\n   component, so the user \"j@s0n\" must have at least the @ sign encoded,\n   as in \"j%40s0n\". Expanding the hname and hvalue tokens in Section 25 show that all URI\n   reserved characters in header field names and values MUST be escaped. The telephone-subscriber subset of the user component has special\n   escaping considerations. The set of characters not reserved in the\n   RFC 2806 [9] description of telephone-subscriber contains a number of\n   characters in various syntax elements that need to be escaped when\n   used in SIP URIs. Any characters occurring in a telephone-subscriber\n   that do not appear in an expansion of the BNF for the user rule MUST\n   be escaped.", "295": "Note that character escaping is not allowed in the host component of\n   a SIP or SIPS URI (the % character is not valid in its expansion). This is likely to change in the future as requirements for\n   Internationalized Domain Names are finalized.

This includes userinfo containing passwords or\n         formatted as telephone-subscribers. Comparison of all other\n         components of the URI is case-insensitive unless explicitly\n         defined otherwise.", "297": "o  The ordering of parameters and header fields is not significant\n         in comparing SIP and SIPS URIs. o  Characters other than those in the \"reserved\" set (see RFC 2396\n         [5]) are equivalent to their \"\"%\" HEX HEX\" encoding. o  An IP address that is the result of a DNS lookup of a host name\n         does not match that host name. o  For two URIs to be equal, the user, password, host, and port\n         components must match. A URI omitting the user component will not match a URI that\n         includes one. A URI omitting the password component will not\n         match a URI that includes one.

These tags are used in Require (Section 20.32),\n   Proxy-Require (Section 20.29), Supported (Section 20.37) and\n   Unsupported (Section 20.40) header fields. Note that these options\n   appear as parameters in those header fields in an option-tag = token\n   form (see Section 25 for the definition of token). Option tags are defined in standards track RFCs.", "308": "This is a change\n   from past practice, and is instituted to ensure continuing multi-\n   vendor interoperability (see discussion in Section 20.32 and Section\n   20.37). An IANA registry of option tags is used to ensure easy\n   reference. 19.3 Tags\n   The \"tag\" parameter is used in the To and From header fields of SIP\n   messages. It serves as a general mechanism to identify a dialog,\n   which is the combination of the Call-ID along with two tags, one from\n   each participant in the dialog. When a UA sends a request outside of\n   a dialog, it contains a From tag only, providing \"half\" of the dialog\n   ID. The dialog is completed from the response(s), each of which\n   contributes the second half in the To header field. The forking of\n   SIP requests means that multiple dialogs can be established from a\n   single request.", "309": "This also explains the need for the two-sided dialog\n   identifier; without a contribution from the recipients, the\n   originator could not disambiguate the multiple dialogs established\n   from a single request. When a tag is generated by a UA for insertion into a request or\n   response, it MUST be globally unique and cryptographically random\n   with at least 32 bits of randomness. A property of this selection\n   requirement is that a UA will place a different tag into the From\n   header of an INVITE than it would place into the To header of the\n   response to the same INVITE. This is needed in order for a UA to\n   invite itself to a session, a common case for \"hairpinning\" of calls\n   in PSTN gateways. Similarly, two INVITEs for different calls will\n   have different From tags, and two responses for different calls will\n   have different To tags. Besides the requirement for global uniqueness, the algorithm for\n   generating a tag is implementation-specific.", "310": "Tags are helpful in\n   fault tolerant systems, where a dialog is to be recovered on an\n   alternate server after a failure. A UAS can select the tag in such a\n   way that a backup can recognize a request as part of a dialog on the\n   failed server, and therefore determine that it should attempt to\n   recover the dialog and any other state associated with it. 20 Header Fields\n   The general syntax for header fields is covered in Section 7.3. This\n   section lists the full set of header fields along with notes on\n   syntax, meaning, and usage. Throughout this section, we use [HX.Y]\n   to refer to Section X.Y of the current HTTP/1.1 specification RFC\n   2616 [8]. Examples of each header field are given. Information about header fields in relation to methods and proxy\n   processing is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The \"where\" column describes the request and response types in which\n   the header field can be used.", "311": "Loose Routing: A proxy is said to be loose routing if it follows\n         the procedures defined in this specification for processing of\n         the Route header field. These procedures separate the\n         destination of the request (present in the Request-URI) from          the set of proxies that need to be visited along the way\n         (present in the Route header field). A proxy compliant to\n         these mechanisms is also known as a loose router. Message: Data sent between SIP elements as part of the protocol. SIP messages are either requests or responses. Method: The method is the primary function that a request is meant\n         to invoke on a server. The method is carried in the request\n         message itself. Example methods are INVITE and BYE. Outbound Proxy: A proxy that receives requests from a client, even\n         though it may not be the server resolved by the Request-URI.", "312": "Values in this column are:\n      R: header field may only appear in requests;\n      r: header field may only appear in responses;\n      2xx, 4xx, etc. : A numerical value or range indicates response\n           codes with which the header field can be used;\n      c: header field is copied from the request to the response. An empty entry in the \"where\" column indicates that the header\n           field may be present in all requests and responses. The \"proxy\" column describes the operations a proxy may perform on a\n   header field:\n      a: A proxy can add or concatenate the header field if not present. m: A proxy can modify an existing header field value. d: A proxy can delete a header field value. r: A proxy must be able to read the header field, and thus this\n           header field cannot be encrypted. The next six columns relate to the presence of a header field in a\n   method:\n      c: Conditional; requirements on the header field depend on the\n           context of the message.", "313": "m: The header field is mandatory. m*: The header field SHOULD be sent, but clients/servers need to\n           be prepared to receive messages without that header field. o: The header field is optional. t: The header field SHOULD be sent, but clients/servers need to be\n           prepared to receive messages without that header field.

See Sections 20.14, 20.15 and 7.4 for details. -: The header field is not applicable. \"Optional\" means that an element MAY include the header field in a\n   request or response, and a UA MAY ignore the header field if present\n   in the request or response (The exception to this rule is the Require\n   header field discussed in 20.32). A \"mandatory\" header field MUST be\n   present in a request, and MUST be understood by the UAS receiving the\n   request.", "314": "A mandatory response header field MUST be present in the\n   response, and the header field MUST be understood by the UAC\n   processing the response. \"Not applicable\" means that the header\n   field MUST NOT be present in a request. If one is placed in a\n   request by mistake, it MUST be ignored by the UAS receiving the\n   request. Similarly, a header field labeled \"not applicable\" for a\n   response means that the UAS MUST NOT place the header field in the\n   response, and the UAC MUST ignore the header field in the response. A UA SHOULD ignore extension header parameters that are not\n   understood. A compact form of some common header field names is also defined for\n   use when overall message size is an issue. The Contact, From, and To header fields contain a URI. If the URI\n   contains a comma, question mark or semicolon, the URI MUST be\n   enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).

(1): copied with possible\n   addition of tag\n      Accept: application/sdp;level=1, application/x-private, text/html\n20.2 Accept-Encoding\n   The Accept-Encoding header field is similar to Accept, but restricts\n   the content-codings [H3.5] that are acceptable in the response.", "317": "See\n   [H14.3]. The semantics in SIP are identical to those defined in\n   [H14.3]. An empty Accept-Encoding header field is permissible. It is\n   equivalent to Accept-Encoding: identity, that is, only the identity\n   encoding, meaning no encoding, is permissible. If no Accept-Encoding header field is present, the server SHOULD\n   assume a default value of identity. This differs slightly from the HTTP definition, which indicates that\n   when not present, any encoding can be used, but the identity encoding\n   is preferred. Example:\n      Accept-Encoding: gzip\n20.3 Accept-Language\n   The Accept-Language header field is used in requests to indicate the\n   preferred languages for reason phrases, session descriptions, or\n   status responses carried as message bodies in the response. If no\n   Accept-Language header field is present, the server SHOULD assume all\n   languages are acceptable to the client. The Accept-Language header field follows the syntax defined in\n   [H14.4].", "318": "The rules for ordering the languages based on the \"q\"\n   parameter apply to SIP as well. Example:\n      Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7\n20.4 Alert-Info\n   When present in an INVITE request, the Alert-Info header field\n   specifies an alternative ring tone to the UAS. When present in a 180\n   (Ringing) response, the Alert-Info header field specifies an\n   alternative ringback tone to the UAC. A typical usage is for a proxy\n   to insert this header field to provide a distinctive ring feature. The Alert-Info header field can introduce security risks. These\n   risks and the ways to handle them are discussed in Section 20.9,\n   which discusses the Call-Info header field since the risks are\n   identical. In addition, a user SHOULD be able to disable this feature\n   selectively. This helps prevent disruptions that could result from the use of\n      this header field by untrusted elements.", "319": "Example:\n      Alert-Info: <http://www.example.com/sounds/moo.wav>\n20.5 Allow\n   The Allow header field lists the set of methods supported by the UA\n   generating the message. All methods, including ACK and CANCEL, understood by the UA MUST be\n   included in the list of methods in the Allow header field, when\n   present. The absence of an Allow header field MUST NOT be\n   interpreted to mean that the UA sending the message supports no\n   methods. Rather, it implies that the UA is not providing any\n   information on what methods it supports. Supplying an Allow header field in responses to methods other than\n   OPTIONS reduces the number of messages needed. Example:\n      Allow: INVITE, ACK, OPTIONS, CANCEL, BYE\n20.6 Authentication-Info\n   The Authentication-Info header field provides for mutual\n   authentication with HTTP Digest. A UAS MAY include this header field\n   in a 2xx response to a request that was successfully authenticated\n   using digest based on the Authorization header field.", "320": "Syntax and semantics follow those specified in RFC 2617 [17]. Example:\n      Authentication-Info: nextnonce=\"47364c23432d2e131a5fb210812c\"\n20.7 Authorization\n   The Authorization header field contains authentication credentials of\n   a UA. Section 22.2 overviews the use of the Authorization header\n   field, and Section 22.4 describes the syntax and semantics when used\n   with HTTP authentication. This header field, along with Proxy-Authorization, breaks the general\n   rules about multiple header field values. Although not a comma-\n   separated list, this header field name may be present multiple times,\n   and MUST NOT be combined into a single header line using the usual\n   rules described in Section 7.3.", "321": "In the example below, there are no quotes around the Digest\n   parameter:\n      Authorization: Digest username=\"Alice\", realm=\"atlanta.com\",\n       nonce=\"84a4cc6f3082121f32b42a2187831a9e\",\n       response=\"7587245234b3434cc3412213e5f113a5432\"\n20.8 Call-ID\n   The Call-ID header field uniquely identifies a particular invitation\n   or all registrations of a particular client. A single multimedia\n   conference can give rise to several calls with different Call-IDs,\n   for example, if a user invites a single individual several times to\n   the same (long-running) conference. Call-IDs are case-sensitive and\n   are simply compared byte-by-byte. The compact form of the Call-ID header field is i. Examples:\n      Call-ID: f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@biloxi.com\n      i:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@192.0.2.4\n20.9 Call-Info\n   The Call-Info header field provides additional information about the\n   caller or callee, depending on whether it is found in a request or\n   response.", "322": "Typically, a UA is manually configured with an outbound proxy,\n         or can learn about one through auto-configuration protocols. Parallel Search: In a parallel search, a proxy issues several\n         requests to possible user locations upon receiving an incoming\n         request. Rather than issuing one request and then waiting for\n         the final response before issuing the next request as in a\n         sequential search, a parallel search issues requests without\n         waiting for the result of previous requests. Provisional Response: A response used by the server to indicate\n         progress, but that does not terminate a SIP transaction. 1xx\n         responses are provisional, other responses are considered\n         final. Proxy, Proxy Server: An intermediary entity that acts as both a\n         server and a client for the purpose of making requests on\n         behalf of other clients.", "323": "The purpose of the URI is described by the \"purpose\"\n   parameter. The \"icon\" parameter designates an image suitable as an\n   iconic representation of the caller or callee. The \"info\" parameter\n   describes the caller or callee in general, for example, through a web\n   page. The \"card\" parameter provides a business card, for example, in\n   vCard [36] or LDIF [37] formats. Additional tokens can be registered\n   using IANA and the procedures in Section 27. Use of the Call-Info header field can pose a security risk. If a\n   callee fetches the URIs provided by a malicious caller, the callee\n   may be at risk for displaying inappropriate or offensive content,\n   dangerous or illegal content, and so on. Therefore, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that a UA only render the information in the Call-Info\n   header field if it can verify the authenticity of the element that\n   originated the header field and trusts that element. This need not\n   be the peer UA; a proxy can insert this header field into requests.", "324": "Example:\n   Call-Info: <http://wwww.example.com/alice/photo.jpg> ;purpose=icon,\n     <http://www.example.com/alice/> ;purpose=info\n20.10 Contact\n   A Contact header field value provides a URI whose meaning depends on\n   the type of request or response it is in. A Contact header field value can contain a display name, a URI with\n   URI parameters, and header parameters. This document defines the Contact parameters \"q\" and \"expires\". These parameters are only used when the Contact is present in a\n   REGISTER request or response, or in a 3xx response. Additional\n   parameters may be defined in other specifications. When the header field value contains a display name, the URI\n   including all URI parameters is enclosed in \"<\" and \">\". If no \"<\"\n   and \">\" are present, all parameters after the URI are header\n   parameters, not URI parameters. The display name can be tokens, or a\n   quoted string, if a larger character set is desired.", "325": "Even if the \"display-name\" is empty, the \"name-addr\" form MUST be\n   used if the \"addr-spec\" contains a comma, semicolon, or question\n   mark. There may or may not be LWS between the display-name and the\n   \"<\". These rules for parsing a display name, URI and URI parameters, and\n   header parameters also apply for the header fields To and From. The Contact header field has a role similar to the Location header\n      field in HTTP. However, the HTTP header field only allows one\n      address, unquoted. Since URIs can contain commas and semicolons\n      as reserved characters, they can be mistaken for header or\n      parameter delimiters, respectively. The compact form of the Contact header field is m (for \"moved\").", "326": "Examples:\n      Contact: \"Mr. Watson\" <sip:watson@worcester.bell-telephone.com>\n         ;q=0.7; expires=3600,\n         \"Mr. Watson\" <mailto:watson@bell-telephone.com> ;q=0.1\n      m: <sips:bob@192.0.2.4>;expires=60\n20.11 Content-Disposition\n   The Content-Disposition header field describes how the message body\n   or, for multipart messages, a message body part is to be interpreted\n   by the UAC or UAS. This SIP header field extends the MIME Content-\n   Type (RFC 2183 [18]). Several new \"disposition-types\" of the Content-Disposition header are\n   defined by SIP. The value \"session\" indicates that the body part\n   describes a session, for either calls or early (pre-call) media. The\n   value \"render\" indicates that the body part should be displayed or\n   otherwise rendered to the user.", "327": "Note that the value \"render\" is used\n   rather than \"inline\" to avoid the connotation that the MIME body is\n   displayed as a part of the rendering of the entire message (since the\n   MIME bodies of SIP messages oftentimes are not displayed to users). For backward-compatibility, if the Content-Disposition header field\n   is missing, the server SHOULD assume bodies of Content-Type\n   application/sdp are the disposition \"session\", while other content\n   types are \"render\". The disposition type \"icon\" indicates that the body part contains an\n   image suitable as an iconic representation of the caller or callee\n   that could be rendered informationally by a user agent when a message\n   has been received, or persistently while a dialog takes place.", "328": "The\n   value \"alert\" indicates that the body part contains information, such\n   as an audio clip, that should be rendered by the user agent in an\n   attempt to alert the user to the receipt of a request, generally a\n   request that initiates a dialog; this alerting body could for example\n   be rendered as a ring tone for a phone call after a 180 Ringing\n   provisional response has been sent. Any MIME body with a \"disposition-type\" that renders content to the\n   user should only be processed when a message has been properly\n   authenticated. The handling parameter, handling-param, describes how the UAS should\n   react if it receives a message body whose content type or disposition\n   type it does not understand. The parameter has defined values of\n   \"optional\" and \"required\". If the handling parameter is missing, the\n   value \"required\" SHOULD be assumed. The handling parameter is\n   described in RFC 3204 [19].", "329": "If this header field is missing, the MIME type determines the default\n   content disposition. If there is none, \"render\" is assumed. Example:\n      Content-Disposition: session\n20.12 Content-Encoding\n   The Content-Encoding header field is used as a modifier to the\n   \"media-type\". When present, its value indicates what additional\n   content codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what\n   decoding mechanisms MUST be applied in order to obtain the media-type\n   referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is\n   primarily used to allow a body to be compressed without losing the\n   identity of its underlying media type. If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity-body, the\n   content codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were\n   applied. All content-coding values are case-insensitive. IANA acts as a\n   registry for content-coding value tokens. See [H3.5] for a\n   definition of the syntax for content-coding.", "330": "Clients MAY apply content encodings to the body in requests. A\n   server MAY apply content encodings to the bodies in responses. The\n   server MUST only use encodings listed in the Accept-Encoding header\n   field in the request. The compact form of the Content-Encoding header field is e.\n   Examples:\n      Content-Encoding: gzip\n      e: tar\n20.13 Content-Language\n   See [H14.12]. Example:\n      Content-Language: fr\n20.14 Content-Length\n   The Content-Length header field indicates the size of the message-\n   body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient. Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the size of the\n   message-body to be transferred, regardless of the media type of the\n   entity. If a stream-based protocol (such as TCP) is used as\n   transport, the header field MUST be used. The size of the message-body does not include the CRLF separating\n   header fields and body. Any Content-Length greater than or equal to\n   zero is a valid value.", "331": "If no body is present in a message, then the\n   Content-Length header field value MUST be set to zero. The ability to omit Content-Length simplifies the creation of\n      cgi-like scripts that dynamically generate responses. The compact form of the header field is l.\n   Examples:\n      Content-Length: 349\n      l: 173\n20.15 Content-Type\n   The Content-Type header field indicates the media type of the\n   message-body sent to the recipient. The \"media-type\" element is\n   defined in [H3.7]. The Content-Type header field MUST be present if\n   the body is not empty. If the body is empty, and a Content-Type\n   header field is present, it indicates that the body of the specific\n   type has zero length (for example, an empty audio file). The compact form of the header field is c.\n   Examples:\n      Content-Type: application/sdp\n      c: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4\n20.16 CSeq\n   A CSeq header field in a request contains a single decimal sequence\n   number and the request method.", "332": "The sequence number MUST be\n   expressible as a 32-bit unsigned integer. The method part of CSeq is\n   case-sensitive. The CSeq header field serves to order transactions\n   within a dialog, to provide a means to uniquely identify\n   transactions, and to differentiate between new requests and request\n   retransmissions. Two CSeq header fields are considered equal if the\n   sequence number and the request method are identical. Example:\n      CSeq: 4711 INVITE\n20.17 Date\n   The Date header field contains the date and time. Unlike HTTP/1.1,\n   SIP only supports the most recent RFC 1123 [20] format for dates. As\n   in [H3.3], SIP restricts the time zone in SIP-date to \"GMT\", while\n   RFC 1123 allows any time zone. An RFC 1123 date is case-sensitive.

Typically, these\n   architectures will include protocols such as the Real-time Transport\n   Protocol (RTP) (RFC 1889 [28]) for transporting real-time data and\n   providing QoS feedback, the Real-Time streaming protocol (RTSP) (RFC\n   2326 [29]) for controlling delivery of streaming media, the Media    Gateway Control Protocol (MEGACO) (RFC 3015 [30]) for controlling\n   gateways to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and the\n   Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327 [1]) for describing\n   multimedia sessions. Therefore, SIP should be used in conjunction\n   with other protocols in order to provide complete services to the\n   users. However, the basic functionality and operation of SIP does\n   not depend on any of these protocols. SIP does not provide services. Rather, SIP provides primitives that\n   can be used to implement different services.", "334": "A proxy server primarily plays the\n         role of routing, which means its job is to ensure that a\n         request is sent to another entity \"closer\" to the targeted\n         user. Proxies are also useful for enforcing policy (for\n         example, making sure a user is allowed to make a call). A\n         proxy interprets, and, if necessary, rewrites specific parts of\n         a request message before forwarding it. Recursion: A client recurses on a 3xx response when it generates a\n         new request to one or more of the URIs in the Contact header\n         field in the response. Redirect Server: A redirect server is a user agent server that\n         generates 3xx responses to requests it receives, directing the\n         client to contact an alternate set of URIs.

SIP UACs have user interface capabilities ranging from pop-up\n      windows and audio on PC softclients to audio-only on \"black\"\n      phones or endpoints connected via gateways. Rather than forcing a\n      server generating an error to choose between sending an error\n      status code with a detailed reason phrase and playing an audio\n      recording, the Error-Info header field allows both to be sent. The UAC then has the choice of which error indicator to render to\n      the caller. A UAC MAY treat a SIP or SIPS URI in an Error-Info header field as if\n   it were a Contact in a redirect and generate a new INVITE, resulting\n   in a recorded announcement session being established. A non-SIP URI\n   MAY be rendered to the user.", "336": "Examples:\n      SIP/2.0 404 The number you have dialed is not in service\n      Error-Info: <sip:not-in-service-recording@atlanta.com>\n20.19 Expires\n   The Expires header field gives the relative time after which the\n   message (or content) expires. The precise meaning of this is method dependent. The expiration time in an INVITE does not affect the duration of the\n   actual session that may result from the invitation. Session\n   description protocols may offer the ability to express time limits on\n   the session duration, however. The value of this field is an integral number of seconds (in decimal)\n   between 0 and (2**32)-1, measured from the receipt of the request. Example:\n      Expires: 5\n20.20 From\n   The From header field indicates the initiator of the request. This\n   may be different from the initiator of the dialog.

Extension parameters in one header field, not\n   present in the other are ignored for the purposes of comparison. This\n   means that the display name and presence or absence of angle brackets\n   do not affect matching.

This can also be useful when the\n   client is attempting to trace a request chain that appears to be\n   failing or looping in mid-chain.

Protective measures above and\n   beyond those provided by Digest need to be taken to prevent active\n   attackers from modifying SIP requests and responses.

In particular, the BNF for auth-scheme, auth-param,\n   challenge, realm, realm-value, and credentials is identical (although\n   the usage of \"Basic\" as a scheme is not permitted). In SIP, a UAS\n   uses the 401 (Unauthorized) response to challenge the identity of a\n   UAC.

Implementations can negotiate support for these\n         algorithms with the \"SMIMECapabilities\" attribute. o  Each S/MIME body in a SIP message SHOULD be signed with only\n         one certificate. If a UA receives a message with multiple\n         signatures, the outermost signature should be treated as the\n         single certificate for this body.", "422": "For example, the user\n   agent initiating a call acts as a UAC when sending the initial INVITE\n   request and as a UAS when receiving a BYE request from the callee. Similarly, the same software can act as a proxy server for one\n   request and as a redirect server for the next request. Proxy, location, and registrar servers defined above are logical\n   entities; implementations MAY combine them into a single application. 7 SIP Messages\n   SIP is a text-based protocol and uses the UTF-8 charset (RFC 2279\n   [7]). A SIP message is either a request from a client to a server, or a\n   response from a server to a client. Both Request (section 7.1) and Response (section 7.2) messages use\n   the basic format of RFC 2822 [3], even though the syntax differs in\n   character set and syntax specifics.

If a UAS receives a request that contains a tunneled \"message/sip\"\n   S/MIME body, it SHOULD include a tunneled \"message/sip\" body in the\n   response with the same smime-type. Any traditional MIME bodies (such as SDP) SHOULD be attached to the\n   \"inner\" message so that they can also benefit from S/MIME security. Note that \"message/sip\" bodies can be sent as a part of a MIME\n   \"multipart/mixed\" body if any unsecured MIME types should also be\n   transmitted in a request. 23.4.1 Integrity and Confidentiality Properties of SIP Headers\n   When the S/MIME integrity or confidentiality mechanisms are used,\n   there may be discrepancies between the values in the \"inner\" message\n   and values in the \"outer\" message.", "426": "The rules for handling any such\n   differences for all of the header fields described in this document\n   are given in this section. Note that for the purposes of loose timestamping, all SIP messages\n   that tunnel \"message/sip\" SHOULD contain a Date header in both the\n   \"inner\" and \"outer\" headers. 23.4.1.1 Integrity\n   Whenever integrity checks are performed, the integrity of a header\n   field should be determined by matching the value of the header field\n   in the signed body with that in the \"outer\" messages using the\n   comparison rules of SIP as described in 20. Header fields that can be legitimately modified by proxy servers are:\n   Request-URI, Via, Record-Route, Route, Max-Forwards, and Proxy-\n   Authorization. If these header fields are not intact end-to-end,\n   implementations SHOULD NOT consider this a breach of security. Changes to any other header fields defined in this document\n   constitute an integrity violation; users MUST be notified of a\n   discrepancy.", "427": "23.4.1.2 Confidentiality\n   When messages are encrypted, header fields may be included in the\n   encrypted body that are not present in the \"outer\" message. Some header fields must always have a plaintext version because they\n   are required header fields in requests and responses - these include:\n   To, From, Call-ID, CSeq, Contact. While it is probably not useful to\n   provide an encrypted alternative for the Call-ID, CSeq, or Contact,\n   providing an alternative to the information in the \"outer\" To or From\n   is permitted. Note that the values in an encrypted body are not used\n   for the purposes of identifying transactions or dialogs - they are\n   merely informational. If the From header field in an encrypted body\n   differs from the value in the \"outer\" message, the value within the\n   encrypted body SHOULD be displayed to the user, but MUST NOT be used\n   in the \"outer\" header fields of any future messages.", "428": "Primarily, a user agent will want to encrypt header fields that have\n   an end-to-end semantic, including: Subject, Reply-To, Organization,\n   Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Alert-Info, Error-Info,\n   Authentication-Info, Expires, In-Reply-To, Require, Supported,\n   Unsupported, Retry-After, User-Agent, Server, and Warning. If any of\n   these header fields are present in an encrypted body, they should be\n   used instead of any \"outer\" header fields, whether this entails\n   displaying the header field values to users or setting internal\n   states in the UA. They SHOULD NOT however be used in the \"outer\"\n   headers of any future messages. If present, the Date header field MUST always be the same in the\n   \"inner\" and \"outer\" headers. Since MIME bodies are attached to the \"inner\" message,\n   implementations will usually encrypt MIME-specific header fields,\n   including: MIME-Version, Content-Type, Content-Length, Content-\n   Language, Content-Encoding and Content-Disposition.", "429": "The \"outer\"\n   message will have the proper MIME header fields for S/MIME bodies. These header fields (and any MIME bodies they preface) should be\n   treated as normal MIME header fields and bodies received in a SIP\n   message. It is not particularly useful to encrypt the following header fields:\n   Min-Expires, Timestamp, Authorization, Priority, and WWW-\n   Authenticate. This category also includes those header fields that\n   can be changed by proxy servers (described in the preceding section). UAs SHOULD never include these in an \"inner\" message if they are not\n   included in the \"outer\" message. UAs that receive any of these\n   header fields in an encrypted body SHOULD ignore the encrypted\n   values. Note that extensions to SIP may define additional header fields; the\n   authors of these extensions should describe the integrity and\n   confidentiality properties of such header fields.", "430": "If a SIP UA\n   encounters an unknown header field with an integrity violation, it\n   MUST ignore the header field. 23.4.2 Tunneling Integrity and Authentication\n   Tunneling SIP messages within S/MIME bodies can provide integrity for\n   SIP header fields if the header fields that the sender wishes to\n   secure are replicated in a \"message/sip\" MIME body signed with a CMS\n   detached signature. Provided that the \"message/sip\" body contains at least the\n   fundamental dialog identifiers (To, From, Call-ID, CSeq), then a\n   signed MIME body can provide limited authentication. At the very\n   least, if the certificate used to sign the body is unknown to the\n   recipient and cannot be verified, the signature can be used to\n   ascertain that a later request in a dialog was transmitted by the\n   same certificate-holder that initiated the dialog.", "431": "If the recipient\n   of the signed MIME body has some stronger incentive to trust the\n   certificate (they were able to validate it, they acquired it from a\n   trusted repository, or they have used it frequently) then the\n   signature can be taken as a stronger assertion of the identity of the\n   subject of the certificate. In order to eliminate possible confusions about the addition or\n   subtraction of entire header fields, senders SHOULD replicate all\n   header fields from the request within the signed body. Any message\n   bodies that require integrity protection MUST be attached to the\n   \"inner\" message. If a Date header is present in a message with a signed body, the\n   recipient SHOULD compare the header field value with its own internal\n   clock, if applicable. If a significant time discrepancy is detected\n   (on the order of an hour or more), the user agent SHOULD alert the\n   user to the anomaly, and note that it is a potential security breach.", "432": "If an integrity violation in a message is detected by its recipient,\n   the message MAY be rejected with a 403 (Forbidden) response if it is\n   a request, or any existing dialog MAY be terminated. UAs SHOULD\n   notify users of this circumstance and request explicit guidance on\n   how to proceed.", "433": "Both types\n   of messages consist of a start-line, one or more header fields, an\n   empty line indicating the end of the header fields, and an optional\n   message-body. generic-message  =  start-line\n                             *message-header\n                             CRLF\n                             [ message-body ]\n         start-line       =  Request-Line / Status-Line\n   The start-line, each message-header line, and the empty line MUST be\n   terminated by a carriage-return line-feed sequence (CRLF). Note that\n   the empty line MUST be present even if the message-body is not.

Implementers\n   need to be familiar with the notation and content of RFC 2234 in\n   order to understand this specification. Certain basic rules are in\n   uppercase, such as SP, LWS, HTAB, CRLF, DIGIT, ALPHA, etc. Angle\n   brackets are used within definitions to clarify the use of rule\n   names. The use of square brackets is redundant syntactically. It is used as\n   a semantic hint that the specific parameter is optional to use. 25.1 Basic Rules\n   The following rules are used throughout this specification to\n   describe basic parsing constructs. The US-ASCII coded character set\n   is defined by ANSI X3.4-1986. alphanum  =  ALPHA / DIGIT\n   Several rules are incorporated from RFC 2396 [5] but are updated to\n   make them compliant with RFC 2234 [10]. These include:\n      reserved    =  \";\" / \"/\" / \"?\"", "443": "/ \":\" / \"@\" / \"&\" / \"=\" / \"+\"\n                     / \"$\" / \",\"\n      unreserved  =  alphanum / mark\n      mark        =  \"-\" / \"_\" / \".\" / \"!\" / \"\u02dc\" / \"*\" / \"\u2019\"\n                     / \"(\" / \")\"\n      escaped     =  \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\n   SIP header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the\n   continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear\n   white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A\n   recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before\n   interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream. This is intended to behave exactly as HTTP/1.1 as described in RFC\n   2616 [8]. The SWS construct is used when linear white space is\n   optional, generally between tokens and separators.", "444": "For example, SIP can\n   locate a user and deliver an opaque object to his current location. If this primitive is used to deliver a session description written in\n   SDP, for instance, the endpoints can agree on the parameters of a\n   session. If the same primitive is used to deliver a photo of the\n   caller as well as the session description, a \"caller ID\" service can\n   be easily implemented. As this example shows, a single primitive is\n   typically used to provide several different services. SIP does not offer conference control services such as floor control\n   or voting and does not prescribe how a conference is to be managed. SIP can be used to initiate a session that uses some other conference\n   control protocol. Since SIP messages and the sessions they establish\n   can pass through entirely different networks, SIP cannot, and does\n   not, provide any kind of network resource reservation capabilities. The nature of the services provided make security particularly\n   important.", "445": "A Request-Line contains a method name, a Request-URI, and the\n   protocol version separated by a single space (SP) character.

SIP\n           extensions, documented in standards track RFCs, may define\n           additional methods. Request-URI: The Request-URI is a SIP or SIPS URI as described in\n           Section 19.1 or a general URI (RFC 2396 [5]).

The TEXT-UTF8-TRIM rule is used for descriptive field\n   contents that are n t quoted strings, where leading and trailing LWS\n   is not meaningful.

Security solutions are needed that are\n   deployable today, without extensive coordination, in a wide variety\n   of environments and usages. In order to meet these diverse needs,\n   several distinct mechanisms applicable to different aspects and\n   usages of SIP will be required. Note that the security of SIP signaling itself has no bearing on the\n   security of protocols used in concert with SIP such as RTP, or with\n   the security implications of any specific bodies SIP might carry\n   (although MIME security plays a substantial role in securing SIP). Any media associated with a session can be encrypted end-to-end\n   independently of any associated SIP signaling. Media encryption is\n   outside the scope of this document.", "464": "The considerations that follow first examine a set of classic threat\n   models that broadly identify the security needs of SIP. The set of\n   security services required to address these threats is then detailed,\n   followed by an explanation of several security mechanisms that can be\n   used to provide these services. Next, the requirements for\n   implementers of SIP are enumerated, along with exemplary deployments\n   in which these security mechanisms could be used to improve the\n   security of SIP. Some notes on privacy conclude this section. 26.1 Attacks and Threat Models\n   This section details some threats that should be common to most\n   deployments of SIP. These threats have been chosen specifically to\n   illustrate each of the security services that SIP requires.", "465": "The following examples by no means provide an exhaustive list of the\n   threats against SIP; rather, these are \"classic\" threats that\n   demonstrate the need for particular security services that can\n   potentially prevent whole categories of threats. These attacks assume an environment in which attackers can\n   potentially read any packet on the network - it is anticipated that\n   SIP will frequently be used on the public Internet. Attackers on the\n   network may be able to modify packets (perhaps at some compromised\n   intermediary). Attackers may wish to steal services, eavesdrop on\n   communications, or disrupt sessions. 26.1.1 Registration Hijacking\n   The SIP registration mechanism allows a user agent to identify itself\n   to a registrar as a device at which a user (designated by an address\n   of record) is located.", "466": "A registrar assesses the identity asserted in\n   the From header field of a REGISTER message to determine whether this\n   request can modify the contact addresses associated with the\n   address-of-record in the To header field. While these two fields are\n   frequently the same, there are many valid deployments in which a\n   third-party may register contacts on a user\u2019s behalf. The From header field of a SIP request, however, can be modified\n   arbitrarily by the owner of a UA, and this opens the door to\n   malicious registrations. An attacker that successfully impersonates\n   a party authorized to change contacts associated with an address-of-\n   record could, for example, de-register all existing contacts for a\n   URI and then register their own device as the appropriate contact\n   address, thereby directing all requests for the affected user to the\n   attacker\u2019s device.", "467": "Unlike HTTP/1.1, SIP treats the version number as a literal\n           string. In practice, this should make no difference. 7.2 Responses\n   SIP responses are distinguished from requests by having a Status-Line\n   as their start-line. A Status-Line consists of the protocol version\n   followed by a numeric Status-Code and its associated textual phrase,\n   with each element separated by a single SP character. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence. Status-Line  =  SIP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF\n   The Status-Code is a 3-digit integer result code that indicates the\n   outcome of an attempt to understand and satisfy a request. The\n   Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the\n   Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for use by automata,\n   whereas the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. A client\n   is not required to examine or display the Reason-Phrase.", "468": "This threat belongs to a family of threats that rely on the absence\n   of cryptographic assurance of a request\u2019s originator. Any SIP UAS\n   that represents a valuable service (a gateway that interworks SIP\n   requests with traditional telephone calls, for example) might want to\n   control access to its resources by authenticating requests that it\n   receives. Even end-user UAs, for example SIP phones, have an\n   interest in ascertaining the identities of originators of requests. This threat demonstrates the need for security services that enable\n   SIP entities to authenticate the originators of requests. 26.1.2 Impersonating a Server\n   The domain to which a request is destined is generally specified in\n   the Request-URI. UAs commonly contact a server in this domain\n   directly in order to deliver a request. However, there is always a\n   possibility that an attacker could impersonate the remote server, and\n   that the UA\u2019s request could be intercepted by some other party.", "469": "For example, consider a case in which a redirect server at one\n   domain, chicago.com, impersonates a redirect server at another\n   domain, biloxi.com. A user agent sends a request to biloxi.com, but\n   the redirect server at chicago.com answers with a forged response\n   that has appropriate SIP header fields for a response from\n   biloxi.com. The forged contact addresses in the redirection response\n   could direct the originating UA to inappropriate or insecure\n   resources, or simply prevent requests for biloxi.com from succeeding. This family of threats has a vast membership, many of which are\n   critical. As a converse to the registration hijacking threat,\n   consider the case in which a registration sent to biloxi.com is\n   intercepted by chicago.com, which replies to the intercepted\n   registration with a forged 301 (Moved Permanently) response. This\n   response might seem to come from biloxi.com yet designate chicago.com\n   as the appropriate registrar.", "470": "All future REGISTER requests from the\n   originating UA would then go to chicago.com. Prevention of this threat requires a means by which UAs can\n   authenticate the servers to whom they send requests. 26.1.3 Tampering with Message Bodies\n   As a matter of course, SIP UAs route requests through trusted proxy\n   servers. Regardless of how that trust is established (authentication\n   of proxies is discussed elsewhere in this section), a UA may trust a\n   proxy server to route a request, but not to inspect or possibly\n   modify the bodies contained in that request. Consider a UA that is using SIP message bodies to communicate session\n   encryption keys for a media session. Although it trusts the proxy\n   server of the domain it is contacting to deliver signaling properly,\n   it may not want the administrators of that domain to be capable of\n   decrypting any subsequent media session.", "471": "Worse yet, if the proxy\n   server were actively malicious, it could modify the session key,\n   either acting as a man-in-the-middle, or perhaps changing the\n   security characteristics requested by the originating UA. This family of threats applies not only to session keys, but to most\n   conceivable forms of content carried end-to-end in SIP. These might\n   include MIME bodies that should be rendered to the user, SDP, or\n   encapsulated telephony signals, among others. Attackers might\n   attempt to modify SDP bodies, for example, in order to point RTP\n   media streams to a wiretapping device in order to eavesdrop on\n   subsequent voice communications. Also note that some header fields in SIP are meaningful end-to-end,\n   for example, Subject. UAs might be protective of these header fields\n   as well as bodies (a malicious intermediary changing the Subject\n   header field might make an important request appear to be spam, for\n   example).", "472": "However, since many header fields are legitimately\n   inspected or altered by proxy servers as a request is routed, not all\n   header fields should be secured end-to-end. For these reasons, the UA might want to secure SIP message bodies,\n   and in some limited cases header fields, end-to-end. The security\n   services required for bodies include confidentiality, integrity, and\n   authentication. These end-to-end services should be independent of\n   the means used to secure interactions with intermediaries such as\n   proxy servers. 26.1.4 Tearing Down Sessions\n   Once a dialog has been established by initial messaging, subsequent\n   requests can be sent that modify the state of the dialog and/or\n   session. It is critical that principals in a session can be certain\n   that such requests are not forged by attackers.", "473": "Consider a case in which a third-party attacker captures some initial\n   messages in a dialog shared by two parties in order to learn the\n   parameters of the session (To tag, From tag, and so forth) and then\n   inserts a BYE request into the session. The attacker could opt to\n   forge the request such that it seemed to come from either\n   participant. Once the BYE is received by its target, the session\n   will be torn down prematurely. Similar mid-session threats include the transmission of forged re-\n   INVITEs that alter the session (possibly to reduce session security\n   or redirect media streams as part of a wiretapping attack). The most effective countermeasure to this threat is the\n   authentication of the sender of the BYE. In this instance, the\n   recipient needs only know that the BYE came from the same party with\n   whom the corresponding dialog was established (as opposed to\n   ascertaining the absolute identity of the sender).", "474": "Also, if the\n   attacker is unable to learn the parameters of the session due to\n   confidentiality, it would not be possible to forge the BYE. However,\n   some intermediaries (like proxy servers) will need to inspect those\n   parameters as the session is established. 26.1.5 Denial of Service and Amplification\n   Denial-of-service attacks focus on rendering a particular network\n   element unavailable, usually by directing an excessive amount of\n   network traffic at its interfaces. A distributed denial-of-service\n   attack allows one network user to cause multiple network hosts to\n   flood a target host with a large amount of network traffic. In many architectures, SIP proxy servers face the public Internet in\n   order to accept requests from worldwide IP endpoints. SIP creates a\n   number of potential opportunities for distributed denial-of-service\n   attacks that must be recognized and addressed by the implementers and\n   operators of SIP systems.", "475": "Attackers can create bogus requests that contain a falsified source\n   IP address and a corresponding Via header field that identify a\n   targeted host as the originator of the request and then send this\n   request to a large number of SIP network elements, thereby using\n   hapless SIP UAs or proxies to generate denial-of-service traffic\n   aimed at the target. Similarly, attackers might use falsified Route header field values in\n   a request that identify the target host and then send such messages\n   to forking proxies that will amplify messaging sent to the target. Record-Route could be used to similar effect when the attacker is\n   certain that the SIP dialog initiated by the request will result in\n   numerous transactions originating in the backwards direction. A number of denial-of-service attacks open up if REGISTER requests\n   are not properly authenticated and authorized by registrars.", "476": "Attackers could de-register some or all users in an administrative\n   domain, thereby preventing these users from being invited to new\n   sessions. An attacker could also register a large number of contacts\n   designating the same host for a given address-of-record in order to\n   use the registrar and any associated proxy servers as amplifiers in a\n   denial-of-service attack. Attackers might also attempt to deplete\n   available memory and disk resources of a registrar by registering\n   huge numbers of bindings. The use of multicast to transmit SIP requests can greatly increase\n   the potential for denial-of-service attacks. These problems demonstrate a general need to define architectures\n   that minimize the risks of denial-of-service, and the need to be\n   mindful in recommendations for security mechanisms of this class of\n   attacks.", "477": "26.2 Security Mechanisms\n   From the threats described above, we gather that the fundamental\n   security services required for the SIP protocol are: preserving the\n   confidentiality and integrity of messaging, preventing replay attacks\n   or message spoofing, providing for the authentication and privacy of\n   the participants in a session, and preventing denial-of-service\n   attacks. Bodies within SIP messages separately require the security\n   services of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Rather than defining new security mechanisms specific to SIP, SIP\n   reuses wherever possible existing security models derived from the\n   HTTP and SMTP space. Full encryption of messages provides the best means to preserve the\n   confidentiality of signaling - it can also guarantee that messages\n   are not modified by any malicious intermediaries.", "478": "While this specification suggests specific wording for the reason\n   phrase, implementations MAY choose other text, for example, in the\n   language indicated in the Accept-Language header field of the\n   request. The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any categorization role. For this\n   reason, any response with a status code between 100 and 199 is\n   referred to as a \"1xx response\", any response with a status code\n   between 200 and 299 as a \"2xx response\", and so on.", "479": "However, SIP\n   requests and responses cannot be naively encrypted end-to-end in\n   their entirety because message fields such as the Request-URI, Route,\n   and Via need to be visible to proxies in most network architectures\n   so that SIP requests are routed correctly. Note that proxy servers\n   need to modify some features of messages as well (such as adding Via\n   header field values) in order for SIP to function. Proxy servers\n   must therefore be trusted, to some degree, by SIP UAs. To this\n   purpose, low-layer security mechanisms for SIP are recommended, which    encrypt the entire SIP requests or responses on the wire on a hop-\n   by-hop basis, and that allow endpoints to verify the identity of\n   proxy servers to whom they send requests. SIP entities also have a need to identify one another in a secure\n   fashion. When a SIP endpoint asserts the identity of its user to a\n   peer UA or to a proxy server, that identity should in some way be\n   verifiable.", "480": "A cryptographic authentication mechanism is provided in\n   SIP to address this requirement. An independent security mechanism for SIP message bodies supplies an\n   alternative means of end-to-end mutual authentication, as well as\n   providing a limit on the degree to which user agents must trust\n   intermediaries. 26.2.1 Transport and Network Layer Security\n   Transport or network layer security encrypts signaling traffic,\n   guaranteeing message confidentiality and integrity. Oftentimes, certificates are used in the establishment of lower-layer\n   security, and these certificates can also be used to provide a means\n   of authentication in many architectures. Two popular alternatives for providing security at the transport and\n   network layer are, respectively, TLS [25] and IPSec [26]. IPSec is a set of network-layer protocol tools that collectively can\n   be used as a secure replacement for traditional IP (Internet\n   Protocol).", "481": "IPSec is most commonly used in architectures in which a\n   set of hosts or administrative domains have an existing trust\n   relationship with one another. IPSec is usually implemented at the\n   operating system level in a host, or on a security gateway that\n   provides confidentiality and integrity for all traffic it receives\n   from a particular interface (as in a VPN architecture). IPSec can\n   also be used on a hop-by-hop basis. In many architectures IPSec does not require integration with SIP\n   applications; IPSec is perhaps best suited to deployments in which\n   adding security directly to SIP hosts would be arduous. UAs that\n   have a pre-shared keying relationship with their first-hop proxy\n   server are also good candidates to use IPSec. Any deployment of\n   IPSec for SIP would require an IPSec profile describing the protocol\n   tools that would be required to secure SIP. No such profile is given\n   in this document.", "482": "TLS provides transport-layer security over connection-oriented\n   protocols (for the purposes of this document, TCP); \"tls\" (signifying\n   TLS over TCP) can be specified as the desired transport protocol\n   within a Via header field value or a SIP-URI. TLS is most suited to\n   architectures in which hop-by-hop security is required between hosts\n   with no pre-existing trust association. For example, Alice trusts\n   her local proxy server, which after a certificate exchange decides to\n   trust Bob\u2019s local proxy server, which Bob trusts, hence Bob and Alice\n   can communicate securely. TLS must be tightly coupled with a SIP application. Note that\n   transport mechanisms are specified on a hop-by-hop basis in SIP, thus\n   a UA that sends requests over TLS to a proxy server has no assurance\n   that TLS will be used end-to-end. The TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite [6] MUST be supported at\n   a minimum by implementers when TLS is used in a SIP application.", "483": "For\n   purposes of backwards compatibility, proxy servers, redirect servers,\n   and registrars SHOULD support TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA. Implementers MAY also support any other ciphersuite. 26.2.2 SIPS URI Scheme\n   The SIPS URI scheme adheres to the syntax of the SIP URI (described\n   in 19), although the scheme string is \"sips\" rather than \"sip\". The\n   semantics of SIPS are very different from the SIP URI, however. SIPS\n   allows resources to specify that they should be reached securely. A SIPS URI can be used as an address-of-record for a particular user\n   - the URI by which the user is canonically known (on their business\n   cards, in the From header field of their requests, in the To header\n   field of REGISTER requests).", "484": "When used as the Request-URI of a\n   request, the SIPS scheme signifies that each hop over which the\n   request is forwarded, until the request reaches the SIP entity\n   responsible for the domain portion of the Request-URI, must be\n   secured with TLS; once it reaches the domain in question it is\n   handled in accordance with local security and routing policy, quite\n   possibly using TLS for any last hop to a UAS. When used by the\n   originator of a request (as would be the case if they employed a SIPS\n   URI as the address-of-record of the target), SIPS dictates that the\n   entire request path to the target domain be so secured. The SIPS scheme is applicable to many of the other ways in which SIP\n   URIs are used in SIP today in addition to the Request-URI, including\n   in addresses-of-record, contact addresses (the contents of Contact\n   headers, including those of REGISTER methods), and Route headers.", "485": "In\n   each instance, the SIPS URI scheme allows these existing fields to    designate secure resources. The manner in which a SIPS URI is\n   dereferenced in any of these contexts has its own security properties\n   which are detailed in [4]. The use of SIPS in particular entails that mutual TLS authentication\n   SHOULD be employed, as SHOULD the ciphersuite\n   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA. Certificates received in the\n   authentication process SHOULD be validated with root certificates\n   held by the client; failure to validate a certificate SHOULD result\n   in the failure of the request. Note that in the SIPS URI scheme, transport is independent of TLS,\n      and thus \"sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=tcp\" and\n      \"sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp\" are both valid (although\n      note that UDP is not a valid transport for SIPS). The use of\n      \"transport=tls\" has consequently been deprecated, partly because\n      it was specific to a single hop of the request.", "486": "This is a change\n      since RFC 2543. Users that distribute a SIPS URI as an address-of-record may elect to\n   operate devices that refuse requests over insecure transports. 26.2.3 HTTP Authentication\n   SIP provides a challenge capability, based on HTTP authentication,\n   that relies on the 401 and 407 response codes as well as header\n   fields for carrying challenges and credentials. Without significant\n   modification, the reuse of the HTTP Digest authentication scheme in\n   SIP allows for replay protection and one-way authentication. The usage of Digest authentication in SIP is detailed in Section 22.", "487": "26.2.4 S/MIME\n   As is discussed above, encrypting entire SIP messages end-to-end for\n   the purpose of confidentiality is not appropriate because network\n   intermediaries (like proxy servers) need to view certain header\n   fields in order to route messages correctly, and if these\n   intermediaries are excluded from security associations, then SIP\n   messages will essentially be non-routable. However, S/MIME allows SIP UAs to encrypt MIME bodies within SIP,\n   securing these bodies end-to-end without affecting message headers. S/MIME can provide end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for\n   message bodies, as well as mutual authentication. It is also\n   possible to use S/MIME to provide a form of integrity and\n   confidentiality for SIP header fields through SIP message tunneling. The usage of S/MIME in SIP is detailed in Section 23.", "488": "26.3 Implementing Security Mechanisms\n26.3.1 Requirements for Implementers of SIP\n   Proxy servers, redirect servers, and registrars MUST implement TLS,\n   and MUST support both mutual and one-way authentication. It is\n   strongly RECOMMENDED that UAs be capable initiating TLS; UAs MAY also\n   be capable of acting as a TLS server. Proxy servers, redirect\n   servers, and registrars SHOULD possess a site certificate whose\n   subject corresponds to their canonical hostname. UAs MAY have\n   certificates of their own for mutual authentication with TLS, but no\n   provisions are set forth in this document for their use. All SIP\n   elements that support TLS MUST have a mechanism for validating\n   certificates received during TLS negotiation; this entails possession\n   of one or more root certificates issued by certificate authorities\n   (preferably well-known distributors of site certificates comparable\n   to those that issue root certificates for web browsers).", "489": "SIP/2.0 allows\n   six values for the first digit:\n      1xx: Provisional -- request received, continuing to process the\n           request;\n      2xx: Success -- the action was successfully received, understood,\n           and accepted;\n      3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order to\n           complete the request;\n      4xx: Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or cannot be\n           fulfilled at this server;\n      5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an apparently\n           valid request;\n      6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any\n           server. Section 21 defines these classes and describes the individual codes. 7.3 Header Fields\n   SIP header fields are similar to HTTP header fields in both syntax\n   and semantics.

At a high\n   level, UAs authenticate themselves to servers (proxy servers,\n   redirect servers, and registrars) with a Digest username and\n   password; servers authenticate themselves to UAs one hop away, or to\n   another server one hop away (and vice versa), with a site certificate\n   delivered by TLS.", "492": "On a peer-to-peer level, UAs trust the network to authenticate one\n   another ordinarily; however, S/MIME can also be used to provide\n   direct authentication when the network does not, or if the network\n   itself is not trusted. The following is an illustrative example in which these security\n   mechanisms are used by various UAs and servers to prevent the sorts\n   of threats described in Section 26.1. While implementers and network\n   administrators MAY follow the normative guidelines given in the\n   remainder of this section, these are provided only as example\n   implementations. 26.3.2.1 Registration\n   When a UA comes online and registers with its local administrative\n   domain, it SHOULD establish a TLS connection with its registrar\n   (Section 10 describes how the UA reaches its registrar).", "493": "The\n   registrar SHOULD offer a certificate to the UA, and the site\n   identified by the certificate MUST correspond with the domain in\n   which the UA intends to register; for example, if the UA intends to\n   register the address-of-record \u2019alice@atlanta.com\u2019, the site\n   certificate must identify a host within the atlanta.com domain (such\n   as sip.atlanta.com). When it receives the TLS Certificate message,\n   the UA SHOULD verify the certificate and inspect the site identified\n   by the certificate. If the certificate is invalid, revoked, or if it\n   does not identify the appropriate party, the UA MUST NOT send the\n   REGISTER message and otherwise proceed with the registration.

When the UA sends the REGISTER request over the existing\n   TLS connection, the registrar SHOULD challenge the request with a 401\n   (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The \"realm\" parameter\n   within the Proxy-Authenticate header field of the response SHOULD\n   correspond to the domain previously given by the site certificate. When the UAC receives the challenge, it SHOULD either prompt the user\n   for credentials or take an appropriate credential from a keyring\n   corresponding to the \"realm\" parameter in the challenge. The\n   username of this credential SHOULD correspond with the \"userinfo\"\n   portion of the URI in the To header field of the REGISTER request. Once the Digest credentials have been inserted into an appropriate\n   Proxy-Authorization header field, the REGISTER should be resubmitted\n   to the registrar.", "495": "Since the registrar requires the user agent to authenticate\n      itself, it would be difficult for an attacker to forge REGISTER\n      requests for the user\u2019s address-of-record. Also note that since\n      the REGISTER is sent over a confidential TLS connection, attackers\n      will not be able to intercept the REGISTER to record credentials\n      for any possible replay attack. Once the registration has been accepted by the registrar, the UA\n   SHOULD leave this TLS connection open provided that the registrar\n   also acts as the proxy server to which requests are sent for users in\n   this administrative domain. The existing TLS connection will be\n   reused to deliver incoming requests to the UA that has just completed\n   registration.", "496": "Because the UA has already authenticated the server on the other\n      side of the TLS connection, all requests that come over this\n      connection are known to have passed through the proxy server -\n      attackers cannot create spoofed requests that appear to have been\n      sent through that proxy server. 26.3.2.2 Interdomain Requests\n   Now let\u2019s say that Alice\u2019s UA would like to initiate a session with a\n   user in a remote administrative domain, namely \"bob@biloxi.com\". We\n   will also say that the local administrative domain (atlanta.com) has\n   a local outbound proxy. The proxy server that handles inbound requests for an administrative\n   domain MAY also act as a local outbound proxy; for simplicity\u2019s sake\n   we\u2019ll assume this to be the case for atlanta.com (otherwise the user\n   agent would initiate a new TLS connection to a separate server at\n   this point).", "497": "Assuming that the client has completed the registration    process described in the preceding section, it SHOULD reuse the TLS\n   connection to the local proxy server when it sends an INVITE request\n   to another user.

When the local outbound proxy server has validated the credentials\n   presented by the UA in the INVITE, it SHOULD inspect the Request-URI\n   to determine how the message should be routed (see [4]). If the\n   \"domainname\" portion of the Request-URI had corresponded to the local\n   domain (atlanta.com) rather than biloxi.com, then the proxy server\n   would have consulted its location service to determine how best to\n   reach the requested user. Had \"alice@atlanta.com\" been attempting to contact, say,\n      \"alex@atlanta.com\", the local proxy would have proxied to the\n      request to the TLS connection Alex had established with the\n      registrar when he registered.", "498": "Since Alex would receive this\n      request over his authenticated channel, he would be assured that\n      Alice\u2019s request had been authorized by the proxy server of the\n      local administrative domain.

The local outbound proxy server at atlanta.com SHOULD therefore\n   establish a TLS connection with the remote proxy server at\n   biloxi.com. Since both of the participants in this TLS connection\n   are servers that possess site certificates, mutual TLS authentication\n   SHOULD occur. Each side of the connection SHOULD verify and inspect\n   the certificate of the other, noting the domain name that appears in\n   the certificate for comparison with the header fields of SIP\n   messages.

The biloxi proxy MAY have a strict\n   security policy that requires it to reject requests that do not match\n   the administrative domain from which they have been proxied. Such security policies could be instituted to prevent the SIP\n      equivalent of SMTP \u2019open relays\u2019 that are frequently exploited to\n      generate spam.

Once the INVITE has been approved by the biloxi proxy, the proxy\n   server SHOULD identify the existing TLS channel, if any, associated\n   with the user targeted by this request (in this case\n   \"bob@biloxi.com\"). The INVITE should be proxied through this channel\n   to Bob. Since the request is received over a TLS connection that had\n   previously been authenticated as the biloxi proxy, Bob knows that the\n   From header field was not tampered with and that atlanta.com has\n   validated Alice, although not necessarily whether or not to trust\n   Alice\u2019s identity.", "502": "Before they forward the request, both proxy servers SHOULD add a\n   Record-Route header field to the request so that all future requests\n   in this dialog will pass through the proxy servers. The proxy\n   servers can thereby continue to provide security services for the\n   lifetime of this dialog. If the proxy servers do not add themselves\n   to the Record-Route, future messages will pass directly end-to-end\n   between Alice and Bob without any security services (unless the two\n   parties agree on some independent end-to-end security such as\n   S/MIME).

When Carol\n   wishes to send an INVITE to \"bob@biloxi.com\", her UA SHOULD initiate\n   a TLS connection with the biloxi proxy directly (using the mechanism\n   described in [4] to determine how to best to reach the given\n   Request-URI).

The\n   biloxi proxy MAY also have a strict policy that precludes it from\n   even bothering to challenge requests that do not have biloxi.com in\n   the \"domainname\" portion of the From header field - it treats these\n   users as unauthenticated. The biloxi proxy has a policy for Bob that all non-authenticated\n   requests should be redirected to the appropriate contact address\n   registered against \u2019bob@biloxi.com\u2019, namely <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>.

Bob receives this INVITE on an insecure\n   interface, but his UA inspects and, in this instance, recognizes the\n   From header field of the request and subsequently matches a locally\n   cached certificate with the one presented in the signature of the\n   body of the INVITE. He replies in similar fashion, authenticating\n   himself to Carol, and a secure dialog begins. Sometimes firewalls or NATs in an administrative domain could\n      preclude the establishment of a direct TCP connection to a UA. In\n      these cases, proxy servers could also potentially relay requests\n      to UAs in a way that has no trust implications (for example,\n      forgoing an existing TLS connection and forwarding the request\n      over cleartext TCP) as local policy dictates.", "506": "26.3.2.4 DoS Protection\n   In order to minimize the risk of a denial-of-service attack against\n   architectures using these security solutions, implementers should\n   take note of the following guidelines. When the host on which a SIP proxy server is operating is routable\n   from the public Internet, it SHOULD be deployed in an administrative\n   domain with defensive operational policies (blocking source-routed\n   traffic, preferably filtering ping traffic). Both TLS and IPSec can\n   also make use of bastion hosts at the edges of administrative domains\n   that participate in the security associations to aggregate secure\n   tunnels and sockets. These bastion hosts can also take the brunt of\n   denial-of-service attacks, ensuring that SIP hosts within the\n   administrative domain are not encumbered with superfluous messaging.", "507": "No matter what security solutions are deployed, floods of messages\n   directed at proxy servers can lock up proxy server resources and\n   prevent desirable traffic from reaching its destination. There is a\n   computational expense associated with processing a SIP transaction at\n   a proxy server, and that expense is greater for stateful proxy\n   servers than it is for stateless proxy servers. Therefore, stateful\n   proxies are more susceptible to flooding than stateless proxy\n   servers. UAs and proxy servers SHOULD challenge questionable requests with\n   only a single 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication\n   Required), forgoing the normal response retransmission algorithm, and\n   thus behaving statelessly towards unauthenticated requests. Retransmitting the 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication\n      Required) status response amplifies the problem of an attacker\n      using a falsified header field value (such as Via) to direct\n      traffic to a third party.", "508": "In summary, the mutual authentication of proxy servers through\n   mechanisms such as TLS significantly reduces the potential for rogue\n   intermediaries to introduce falsified requests or responses that can\n   deny service. This commensurately makes it harder for attackers to\n   make innocent SIP nodes into agents of amplification. 26.4 Limitations\n   Although these security mechanisms, when applied in a judicious\n   manner, can thwart many threats, there are limitations in the scope\n   of the mechanisms that must be understood by implementers and network\n   operators. 26.4.1 HTTP Digest\n   One of the primary limitations of using HTTP Digest in SIP is that\n   the integrity mechanisms in Digest do not work very well for SIP. Specifically, they offer protection of the Request-URI and the method\n   of a message, but not for any of the header fields that UAs would\n   most likely wish to secure.", "509": "The existing replay protection mechanisms described in RFC 2617 also\n   have some limitations for SIP. The next-nonce mechanism, for\n   example, does not support pipelined requests. The nonce-count\n   mechanism should be used for replay protection. Another limitation of HTTP Digest is the scope of realms. Digest is\n   valuable when a user wants to authenticate themselves to a resource\n   with which they have a pre-existing association, like a service    provider of which the user is a customer (which is quite a common\n   scenario and thus Digest provides an extremely useful function). By\n   way of contrast, the scope of TLS is interdomain or multirealm, since\n   certificates are often globally verifiable, so that the UA can\n   authenticate the server with no pre-existing association. 26.4.2 S/MIME\n   The largest outstanding defect with the S/MIME mechanism is the lack\n   of a prevalent public key infrastructure for end users.", "510": "If self-\n   signed certificates (or certificates that cannot be verified by one\n   of the participants in a dialog) are used, the SIP-based key exchange\n   mechanism described in Section 23.2 is susceptible to a man-in-the-\n   middle attack with which an attacker can potentially inspect and\n   modify S/MIME bodies. The attacker needs to intercept the first\n   exchange of keys between the two parties in a dialog, remove the\n   existing CMS-detached signatures from the request and response, and\n   insert a different CMS-detached signature containing a certificate\n   supplied by the attacker (but which seems to be a certificate for the\n   proper address-of-record). Each party will think they have exchanged\n   keys with the other, when in fact each has the public key of the\n   attacker.", "511": "Each header field consists of a field\n   name followed by a colon (\":\") and the field value. field-name: field-value\n   The formal grammar for a message-header specified in Section 25\n   allows for an arbitrary amount of whitespace on either side of the\n   colon; however, implementations should avoid spaces between the field\n   name and the colon and use a single space (SP) between the colon and\n   the field-value.

Header fields can be extended over multiple lines by preceding each\n   extra line with at least one SP or horizontal tab (HT). The line\n   break and the whitespace at the beginning of the next line are\n   treated as a single SP character. Thus, the following are\n   equivalent:\n      Subject: I know you\u2019re there, pick up the phone and talk to me!", "512": "It is important to note that the attacker can only leverage this\n   vulnerability on the first exchange of keys between two parties - on\n   subsequent occasions, the alteration of the key would be noticeable\n   to the UAs. It would also be difficult for the attacker to remain in\n   the path of all future dialogs between the two parties over time (as\n   potentially days, weeks, or years pass). SSH is susceptible to the same man-in-the-middle attack on the first\n   exchange of keys; however, it is widely acknowledged that while SSH\n   is not perfect, it does improve the security of connections. The use\n   of key fingerprints could provide some assistance to SIP, just as it\n   does for SSH. For example, if two parties use SIP to establish a\n   voice communications session, each could read off the fingerprint of\n   the key they received from the other, which could be compared against\n   the original.", "513": "It would certainly be more difficult for the man-in-\n   the-middle to emulate the voices of the participants than their\n   signaling (a practice that was used with the Clipper chip-based\n   secure telephone). The S/MIME mechanism allows UAs to send encrypted requests without\n   preamble if they possess a certificate for the destination address-\n   of-record on their keyring. However, it is possible that any\n   particular device registered for an address-of-record will not hold\n   the certificate that has been previously employed by the device\u2019s\n   current user, and that it will therefore be unable to process an    encrypted request properly, which could lead to some avoidable error\n   signaling. This is especially likely when an encrypted request is\n   forked. The keys associated with S/MIME are most useful when associated with\n   a particular user (an address-of-record) rather than a device (a UA).", "514": "When users move between devices, it may be difficult to transport\n   private keys securely between UAs; how such keys might be acquired by\n   a device is outside the scope of this document. Another, more prosaic difficulty with the S/MIME mechanism is that it\n   can result in very large messages, especially when the SIP tunneling\n   mechanism described in Section 23.4 is used. For that reason, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that TCP should be used as a transport protocol when\n   S/MIME tunneling is employed. 26.4.3 TLS\n   The most commonly voiced concern about TLS is that it cannot run over\n   UDP; TLS requires a connection-oriented underlying transport\n   protocol, which for the purposes of this document means TCP. It may also be arduous for a local outbound proxy server and/or\n   registrar to maintain many simultaneous long-lived TLS connections\n   with numerous UAs. This introduces some valid scalability concerns,\n   especially for intensive ciphersuites.", "515": "Maintaining redundancy of\n   long-lived TLS connections, especially when a UA is solely\n   responsible for their establishment, could also be cumbersome. TLS only allows SIP entities to authenticate servers to which they\n   are adjacent; TLS offers strictly hop-by-hop security. Neither TLS,\n   nor any other mechanism specified in this document, allows clients to\n   authenticate proxy servers to whom they cannot form a direct TCP\n   connection. 26.4.4 SIPS URIs\n   Actually using TLS on every segment of a request path entails that\n   the terminating UAS must be reachable over TLS (perhaps registering\n   with a SIPS URI as a contact address). This is the preferred use of\n   SIPS. Many valid architectures, however, use TLS to secure part of\n   the request path, but rely on some other mechanism for the final hop\n   to a UAS, for example. Thus SIPS cannot guarantee that TLS usage\n   will be truly end-to-end.", "516": "Note that since many UAs will not accept\n   incoming TLS connections, even those UAs that do support TLS may be\n   required to maintain persistent TLS connections as described in the\n   TLS limitations section above in order to receive requests over TLS\n   as a UAS. Location services are not required to provide a SIPS binding for a\n   SIPS Request-URI. Although location services are commonly populated\n   by user registrations (as described in Section 10.2.1), various other\n   protocols and interfaces could conceivably supply contact addresses\n   for an AOR, and these tools are free to map SIPS URIs to SIP URIs as\n   appropriate. When queried for bindings, a location service returns\n   its contact addresses without regard for whether it received a\n   request with a SIPS Request-URI. If a redirect server is accessing\n   the location service, it is up to the entity that processes the\n   Contact header field of a redirection to determine the propriety of\n   the contact addresses.", "517": "Ensuring that TLS will be used for all of the request segments up to\n   the target domain is somewhat complex. It is possible that\n   cryptographically authenticated proxy servers along the way that are\n   non-compliant or compromised may choose to disregard the forwarding\n   rules associated with SIPS (and the general forwarding rules in\n   Section 16.6). Such malicious intermediaries could, for example,\n   retarget a request from a SIPS URI to a SIP URI in an attempt to\n   downgrade security. Alternatively, an intermediary might legitimately retarget a request\n   from a SIP to a SIPS URI. Recipients of a request whose Request-URI\n   uses the SIPS URI scheme thus cannot assume on the basis of the\n   Request-URI alone that SIPS was used for the entire request path\n   (from the client onwards).", "518": "To address these concerns, it is RECOMMENDED that recipients of a\n   request whose Request-URI contains a SIP or SIPS URI inspect the To\n   header field value to see if it contains a SIPS URI (though note that\n   it does not constitute a breach of security if this URI has the same\n   scheme but is not equivalent to the URI in the To header field). Although clients may choose to populate the Request-URI and To header\n   field of a request differently, when SIPS is used this disparity\n   could be interpreted as a possible security violation, and the\n   request could consequently be rejected by its recipient. Recipients\n   MAY also inspect the Via header chain in order to double-check\n   whether or not TLS was used for the entire request path until the\n   local administrative domain was reached. S/MIME may also be used by\n   the originating UAC to help ensure that the original form of the To\n   header field is carried end-to-end.", "519": "If the UAS has reason to believe that the scheme of the Request-URI\n   has been improperly modified in transit, the UA SHOULD notify its\n   user of a potential security breach. As a further measure to prevent downgrade attacks, entities that\n   accept only SIPS requests MAY also refuse connections on insecure\n   ports. End users will undoubtedly discern the difference between SIPS and\n   SIP URIs, and they may manually edit them in response to stimuli. This can either benefit or degrade security. For example, if an\n   attacker corrupts a DNS cache, inserting a fake record set that\n   effectively removes all SIPS records for a proxy server, then any\n   SIPS requests that traverse this proxy server may fail. When a user,\n   however, sees that repeated calls to a SIPS AOR are failing, they\n   could on some devices manually convert the scheme from SIPS to SIP\n   and retry.", "520": "Of course, there are some safeguards against this (if the\n   destination UA is truly paranoid it could refuse all non-SIPS\n   requests), but it is a limitation worth noting. On the bright side,\n   users might also divine that \u2019SIPS\u2019 would be valid even when they are\n   presented only with a SIP URI. 26.5 Privacy\n   SIP messages frequently contain sensitive information about their\n   senders - not just what they have to say, but with whom they\n   communicate, when they communicate and for how long, and from where\n   they participate in sessions. Many applications and their users\n   require that this sort of private information be hidden from any\n   parties that do not need to know it. Note that there are also less direct ways in which private\n   information can be divulged.", "521": "If a user or service chooses to be\n   reachable at an address that is guessable from the person\u2019s name and\n   organizational affiliation (which describes most addresses-of-\n   record), the traditional method of ensuring privacy by having an\n   unlisted \"phone number\" is compromised. A user location service can\n   infringe on the privacy of the recipient of a session invitation by\n   divulging their specific whereabouts to the caller; an implementation\n   consequently SHOULD be able to restrict, on a per-user basis, what\n   kind of location and availability information is given out to certain\n   classes of callers. This is a whole class of problem that is\n   expected to be studied further in ongoing SIP work. In some cases, users may want to conceal personal information in\n   header fields that convey identity.", "522": "Subject: I know you\u2019re there,\n               pick up the phone\n               and talk to me! The relative order of header fields with different field names is not\n   significant. However, it is RECOMMENDED that header fields which are\n   needed for proxy processing (Via, Route, Record-Route, Proxy-Require,\n   Max-Forwards, and Proxy-Authorization, for example) appear towards\n   the top of the message to facilitate rapid parsing. The relative\n   order of header field rows with the same field name is important. Multiple header field rows with the same field-name MAY be present in\n   a message if and only if the entire field-value for that header field\n   is defined as a comma-separated list (that is, if follows the grammar\n   defined in Section 7.3). It MUST be possible to combine the multiple\n   header field rows into one \"field-name: field-value\" pair, without\n   changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent\n   field-value to the first, each separated by a comma.", "523": "This can apply not only to the\n   From and related headers representing the originator of the request,\n   but also the To - it may not be appropriate to convey to the final\n   destination a speed-dialing nickname, or an unexpanded identifier for\n   a group of targets, either of which would be removed from the\n   Request-URI as the request is routed, but not changed in the To    header field if the two were initially identical. Thus it MAY be\n   desirable for privacy reasons to create a To header field that\n   differs from the Request-URI. 27 IANA Considerations\n   All method names, header field names, status codes, and option tags\n   used in SIP applications are registered with IANA through\n   instructions in an IANA Considerations section in an RFC.", "524": "The specification instructs the IANA to create four new sub-\n   registries under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:\n   Option Tags, Warning Codes (warn-codes), Methods and Response Codes,\n   added to the sub-registry of Header Fields that is already present\n   there. 27.1 Option Tags\n   This specification establishes the Option Tags sub-registry under\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters.

The option tag itself is a\n   string that is associated with a particular SIP option (that is, an\n   extension). It identifies the option to SIP endpoints. Option tags are registered by the IANA when they are published in\n   standards track RFCs.", "525": "The IANA Considerations section of the RFC\n   must include the following information, which appears in the IANA\n   registry along with the RFC number of the publication. o  Name of the option tag.

Additional\n   warn-codes are registered by RFC publication. The descriptive text for the table of warn-codes is:\n   Warning codes provide information supplemental to the status code in\n   SIP response messages when the failure of the transaction results\n   from a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 2327 [1]) problem.

It is mostly backwards compatible with\n   RFC 2543. The changes described here fix many errors discovered in\n   RFC 2543 and provide information on scenarios not detailed in RFC\n   2543. The protocol has been presented in a more cleanly layered\n   model here.", "532": "We break the differences into functional behavior that is a\n   substantial change from RFC 2543, which has impact on\n   interoperability or correct operation in some cases, and functional\n   behavior that is different from RFC 2543 but not a potential source\n   of interoperability problems. There have been countless\n   clarifications as well, which are not documented here. 28.1 Major Functional Changes\n   o  When a UAC wishes to terminate a call before it has been answered,\n      it sends CANCEL. If the original INVITE still returns a 2xx, the\n      UAC then sends BYE. BYE can only be sent on an existing call leg\n      (now called a dialog in this RFC), whereas it could be sent at any\n      time in RFC 2543.\n   o  The SIP BNF was converted to be RFC 2234 compliant. o  SIP URL BNF was made more general, allowing a greater set of\n      characters in the user part.", "533": "The exceptions\n   to this rule are the WWW-Authenticate, Authorization, Proxy-\n   Authenticate, and Proxy-Authorization header fields. Multiple header    field rows with these names MAY be present in a message, but since\n   their grammar does not follow the general form listed in Section 7.3,\n   they MUST NOT be combined into a single header field row. Implementations MUST be able to process multiple header field rows\n   with the same name in any combination of the single-value-per-line or\n   comma-separated value forms.", "534": "Furthermore, comparison rules were\n      simplified to be primarily case-insensitive, and detailed handling\n      of comparison in the presence of parameters was described. The\n      most substantial change is that a URI with a parameter with the\n      default value does not match a URI without that parameter. o  Removed Via hiding. It had serious trust issues, since it relied\n      on the next hop to perform the obfuscation process. Instead, Via\n      hiding can be done as a local implementation choice in stateful\n      proxies, and thus is no longer documented. o  In RFC 2543, CANCEL and INVITE transactions were intermingled. They are separated now. When a user sends an INVITE and then a\n      CANCEL, the INVITE transaction still terminates normally. A UAS\n      needs to respond to the original INVITE request with a 487\n      response. o  Similarly, CANCEL and BYE transactions were intermingled; RFC 2543\n      allowed the UAS not to send a response to INVITE when a BYE was\n      received.", "535": "That is disallowed here. The original INVITE needs a\n      response. o  In RFC 2543, UAs needed to support only UDP. In this RFC, UAs\n      need to support both UDP and TCP. o  In RFC 2543, a forking proxy only passed up one challenge from\n      downstream elements in the event of multiple challenges. In this\n      RFC, proxies are supposed to collect all challenges and place them\n      into the forwarded response. o  In Digest credentials, the URI needs to be quoted; this is unclear\n      from RFC 2617 and RFC 2069 which are both inconsistent on it. o  SDP processing has been split off into a separate specification\n      [13], and more fully specified as a formal offer/answer exchange\n      process that is effectively tunneled through SIP. SDP is allowed\n      in INVITE/200 or 200/ACK for baseline SIP implementations; RFC\n      2543 alluded to the ability to use it in INVITE, 200, and ACK in a\n      single transaction, but this was not well specified.", "536": "More complex\n      SDP usages are allowed in extensions. o  Added full support for IPv6 in URIs and in the Via header field. Support for IPv6 in Via has required that its header field\n      parameters allow the square bracket and colon characters. These\n      characters were previously not permitted. In theory, this could\n      cause interop problems with older implementations. However, we\n      have observed that most implementations accept any non-control\n      ASCII character in these parameters. o  DNS SRV procedure is now documented in a separate specification\n      [4]. This procedure uses both SRV and NAPTR resource records and\n      no longer combines data from across SRV records as described in\n      RFC 2543.\n   o  Loop detection has been made optional, supplanted by a mandatory\n      usage of Max-Forwards. The loop detection procedure in RFC 2543\n      had a serious bug which would report \"spirals\" as an error\n      condition when it was not.", "537": "The optional loop detection procedure\n      is more fully and correctly specified here. o  Usage of tags is now mandatory (they were optional in RFC 2543),\n      as they are now the fundamental building blocks of dialog\n      identification. o  Added the Supported header field, allowing for clients to indicate\n      what extensions are supported to a server, which can apply those\n      extensions to the response, and indicate their usage with a\n      Require in the response. o  Extension parameters were missing from the BNF for several header\n      fields, and they have been added. o  Handling of Route and Record-Route construction was very\n      underspecified in RFC 2543, and also not the right approach. It\n      has been substantially reworked in this specification (and made\n      vastly simpler), and this is arguably the largest change.", "538": "Backwards compatibility is still provided for deployments that do\n      not use \"pre-loaded routes\", where the initial request has a set\n      of Route header field values obtained in some way outside of\n      Record-Route. In those situations, the new mechanism is not\n      interoperable. o  In RFC 2543, lines in a message could be terminated with CR, LF,\n      or CRLF. This specification only allows CRLF. o  Usage of Route in CANCEL and ACK was not well defined in RFC 2543. It is now well specified; if a request had a Route header field,\n      its CANCEL or ACK for a non-2xx response to the request need to\n      carry the same Route header field values. ACKs for 2xx responses\n      use the Route values learned from the Record-Route of the 2xx\n      responses. o  RFC 2543 allowed multiple requests in a single UDP packet. This\n      usage has been removed. o  Usage of absolute time in the Expires header field and parameter\n      has been removed.", "539": "It caused interoperability problems in elements\n      that were not time synchronized, a common occurrence. Relative\n      times are used instead. o  The branch parameter of the Via header field value is now\n      mandatory for all elements to use. It now plays the role of a\n      unique transaction identifier. This avoids the complex and bug-\n      laden transaction identification rules from RFC 2543. A magic\n      cookie is used in the parameter value to determine if the previous\n      hop has made the parameter globally unique, and comparison falls\n      back to the old rules when it is not present. Thus,\n      interoperability is assured. o  In RFC 2543, closure of a TCP connection was made equivalent to a\n      CANCEL. This was nearly impossible to implement (and wrong) for\n      TCP connections between proxies. This has been eliminated, so\n      that there is no coupling between TCP connection state and SIP\n      processing.", "540": "o  RFC 2543 was silent on whether a UA could initiate a new\n      transaction to a peer while another was in progress. That is now\n      specified here. It is allowed for non-INVITE requests, disallowed\n      for INVITE. o  PGP was removed. It was not sufficiently specified, and not\n      compatible with the more complete PGP MIME. It was replaced with\n      S/MIME. o  Added the \"sips\" URI scheme for end-to-end TLS. This scheme is\n      not backwards compatible with RFC 2543. Existing elements that\n      receive a request with a SIPS URI scheme in the Request-URI will\n      likely reject the request. This is actually a feature; it ensures\n      that a call to a SIPS URI is only delivered if all path hops can\n      be secured. o  Additional security features were added with TLS, and these are\n      described in a much larger and complete security considerations\n      section. o  In RFC 2543, a proxy was not required to forward provisional\n      responses from 101 to 199 upstream.", "541": "This was changed to MUST. This is important, since many subsequent features depend on\n      delivery of all provisional responses from 101 to 199.\n   o  Little was said about the 503 response code in RFC 2543. It has\n      since found substantial use in indicating failure or overload\n      conditions in proxies. This requires somewhat special treatment. Specifically, receipt of a 503 should trigger an attempt to\n      contact the next element in the result of a DNS SRV lookup. Also,\n      503 response is only forwarded upstream by a proxy under certain\n      conditions. o  RFC 2543 defined, but did no sufficiently specify, a mechanism for\n      UA authentication of a server. That has been removed. Instead,\n      the mutual authentication procedures of RFC 2617 are allowed. o  A UA cannot send a BYE for a call until it has received an ACK for\n      the initial INVITE. This was allowed in RFC 2543 but leads to a\n      potential race condition.", "542": "o  A UA or proxy cannot send CANCEL for a transaction until it gets a\n      provisional response for the request. This was allowed in RFC\n      2543 but leads to potential race conditions. o  The action parameter in registrations has been deprecated. It was\n      insufficient for any useful services, and caused conflicts when\n      application processing was applied in proxies. o  RFC 2543 had a number of special cases for multicast. For\n      example, certain responses were suppressed, timers were adjusted,\n      and so on. Multicast now plays a more limited role, and the\n      protocol operation is unaffected by usage of multicast as opposed\n      to unicast. The limitations as a result of that are documented. o  Basic authentication has been removed entirely and its usage\n      forbidden. o  Proxies no longer forward a 6xx immediately on receiving it. Instead, they CANCEL pending branches immediately.", "543": "This avoids a\n      potential race condition that would result in a UAC getting a 6xx\n      followed by a 2xx. In all cases except this race condition, the\n      result will be the same - the 6xx is forwarded upstream. o  RFC 2543 did not address the problem of request merging. This\n      occurs when a request forks at a proxy and later rejoins at an\n      element. Handling of merging is done only at a UA, and procedures\n      are defined for rejecting all but the first request. 28.2 Minor Functional Changes\n   o  Added the Alert-Info, Error-Info, and Call-Info header fields for\n      optional content presentation to users. o  Added the Content-Language, Content-Disposition and MIME-Version\n      header fields. o  Added a \"glare handling\" mechanism to deal with the case where\n      both parties send each other a re-INVITE simultaneously.

This section is tutorial in nature and does not contain\n   any normative statements. The first example shows the basic functions of SIP: location of an\n   end point, signal of a desire to communicate, negotiation of session\n   parameters to establish the session, and teardown of the session once\n   established.", "548": "It\n   will always be either an opaque sequence of TEXT-UTF8 octets, or a\n   combination of whitespace, tokens, separators, and quoted strings. Many existing header fields will adhere to the general form of a\n   value followed by a semi-colon separated sequence of parameter-name,\n   parameter-value pairs:\n         field-name: field-value *(;parameter-name=parameter-value)    Even though an arbitrary number of parameter pairs may be attached to\n   a header field value, any given parameter-name MUST NOT appear more\n   than once. When comparing header fields, field names are always case-\n   insensitive. Unless otherwise stated in the definition of a\n   particular header field, field values, parameter names, and parameter\n   values are case-insensitive. Tokens are always case-insensitive. Unless specified otherwise, values expressed as quoted strings are\n   case-sensitive.", "549": "For example,\n      Contact: <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;expires=3600\n   is equivalent to\n      CONTACT: <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;ExPiReS=3600\n   and\n      Content-Disposition: session;handling=optional\n   is equivalent to\n      content-disposition: Session;HANDLING=OPTIONAL\n   The following two header fields are not equivalent:\n      Warning: 370 devnull \"Choose a bigger pipe\"\n      Warning: 370 devnull \"CHOOSE A BIGGER PIPE\"\n7.3.2 Header Field Classification\n   Some header fields only make sense in requests or responses. These\n   are called request header fields and response header fields,\n   respectively. If a header field appears in a message not matching\n   its category (such as a request header field in a response), it MUST\n   be ignored. Section 20 defines the classification of each header\n   field. 7.3.3 Compact Form\n   SIP provides a mechanism to represent common header field names in an\n   abbreviated form.", "550": "This may be useful when messages would otherwise\n   become too large to be carried on the transport available to it\n   (exceeding the maximum transmission unit (MTU) when using UDP, for\n   example). These compact forms are defined in Section 20. A compact\n   form MAY be substituted for the longer form of a header field name at\n   any time without changing the semantics of the message. A header    field name MAY appear in both long and short forms within the same\n   message. Implementations MUST accept both the long and short forms\n   of each header name. 7.4 Bodies\n   Requests, including new requests defined in extensions to this\n   specification, MAY contain message bodies unless otherwise noted. The interpretation of the body depends on the request method. For response messages, the request method and the response status\n   code determine the type and interpretation of any message body. All\n   responses MAY include a body.", "551": "7.4.1 Message Body Type\n   The Internet media type of the message body MUST be given by the\n   Content-Type header field. If the body has undergone any encoding\n   such as compression, then this MUST be indicated by the Content-\n   Encoding header field; otherwise, Content-Encoding MUST be omitted. If applicable, the character set of the message body is indicated as\n   part of the Content-Type header-field value. The \"multipart\" MIME type defined in RFC 2046 [11] MAY be used within\n   the body of the message. Implementations that send requests\n   containing multipart message bodies MUST send a session description\n   as a non-multipart message body if the remote implementation requests\n   this through an Accept header field that does not contain multipart. SIP messages MAY contain binary bodies or body parts. When no\n   explicit charset parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes\n   of the \"text\" type are defined to have a default charset value of\n   \"UTF-8\".", "552": "7.4.2 Message Body Length\n   The body length in bytes is provided by the Content-Length header\n   field. Section 20.14 describes the necessary contents of this header\n   field in detail. The \"chunked\" transfer encoding of HTTP/1.1 MUST NOT be used for SIP. (Note: The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order\n   to transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size\n   indicator.) 7.5 Framing SIP Messages\n   Unlike HTTP, SIP implementations can use UDP or other unreliable\n   datagram protocols. Each such datagram carries one request or\n   response. See Section 18 on constraints on usage of unreliable\n   transports. Implementations processing SIP messages over stream-oriented\n   transports MUST ignore any CRLF appearing before the start-line\n   [H4.1]. The Content-Length header field value is used to locate the end of\n      each SIP message in a stream. It will always be present when SIP\n      messages are sent over stream-oriented transports.", "553": "8 General User Agent Behavior\n   A user agent represents an end system. It contains a user agent\n   client (UAC), which generates requests, and a user agent server\n   (UAS), which responds to them. A UAC is capable of generating a\n   request based on some external stimulus (the user clicking a button,\n   or a signal on a PSTN line) and processing a response. A UAS is\n   capable of receiving a request and generating a response based on\n   user input, external stimulus, the result of a program execution, or\n   some other mechanism. When a UAC sends a request, the request passes through some number of\n   proxy servers, which forward the request towards the UAS. When the\n   UAS generates a response, the response is forwarded towards the UAC. UAC and UAS procedures depend strongly on two factors. First, based\n   on whether the request or response is inside or outside of a dialog,\n   and second, based on the method of a request.", "554": "Dialogs are discussed\n   thoroughly in Section 12; they represent a peer-to-peer relationship\n   between user agents and are established by specific SIP methods, such\n   as INVITE. In this section, we discuss the method-independent rules for UAC and\n   UAS behavior when processing requests that are outside of a dialog. This includes, of course, the requests which themselves establish a\n   dialog. Security procedures for requests and responses outside of a dialog\n   are described in Section 26. Specifically, mechanisms exist for the\n   UAS and UAC to mutually authenticate. A limited set of privacy\n   features are also supported through encryption of bodies using\n   S/MIME. 8.1 UAC Behavior\n   This section covers UAC behavior outside of a dialog. 8.1.1 Generating the Request\n   A valid SIP request formulated by a UAC MUST, at a minimum, contain\n   the following header fields: To, From, CSeq, Call-ID, Max-Forwards,\n   and Via; all of these header fields are mandatory in all SIP\n   requests.", "555": "These six header fields are the fundamental building\n   blocks of a SIP message, as they jointly provide for most of the\n   critical message routing services including the addressing of\n   messages, the routing of responses, limiting message propagation,\n   ordering of messages, and the unique identification of transactions. These header fields are in addition to the mandatory request line,\n   which contains the method, Request-URI, and SIP version. Examples of requests sent outside of a dialog include an INVITE to\n   establish a session (Section 13) and an OPTIONS to query for\n   capabilities (Section 11). 8.1.1.1 Request-URI\n   The initial Request-URI of the message SHOULD be set to the value of\n   the URI in the To field. One notable exception is the REGISTER\n   method; behavior for setting the Request-URI of REGISTER is given in\n   Section 10.", "556": "It may also be undesirable for privacy reasons or\n   convenience to set these fields to the same value (especially if the\n   originating UA expects that the Request-URI will be changed during\n   transit). In some special circumstances, the presence of a pre-existing route\n   set can affect the Request-URI of the message. A pre-existing route\n   set is an ordered set of URIs that identify a chain of servers, to\n   which a UAC will send outgoing requests that are outside of a dialog. Commonly, they are configured on the UA by a user or service provider\n   manually, or through some other non-SIP mechanism. When a provider\n   wishes to configure a UA with an outbound proxy, it is RECOMMENDED\n   that this be done by providing it with a pre-existing route set with\n   a single URI, that of the outbound proxy.", "557": "When a pre-existing route set is present, the procedures for\n   populating the Request-URI and Route header field detailed in Section\n   12.2.1.1 MUST be followed (even though there is no dialog), using the\n   desired Request-URI as the remote target URI. 8.1.1.2 To\n   The To header field first and foremost specifies the desired\n   \"logical\" recipient of the request, or the address-of-record of the\n   user or resource that is the target of this request. This may or may\n   not be the ultimate recipient of the request. The To header field\n   MAY contain a SIP or SIPS URI, but it may also make use of other URI\n   schemes (the tel URL (RFC 2806 [9]), for example) when appropriate. All SIP implementations MUST support the SIP URI scheme. Any\n   implementation that supports TLS MUST support the SIPS URI scheme. The To header field allows for a display name. A UAC may learn how to populate the To header field for a particular\n   request in a number of ways.", "558": "Figure 1 shows a typical example of a SIP message exchange between\n   two users, Alice and Bob. (Each message is labeled with the letter\n   \"F\" and a number for reference by the text.) In this example, Alice\n   uses a SIP application on her PC (referred to as a softphone) to call\n   Bob on his SIP phone over the Internet. Also shown are two SIP proxy\n   servers that act on behalf of Alice and Bob to facilitate the session\n   establishment. This typical arrangement is often referred to as the\n   \"SIP trapezoid\" as shown by the geometric shape of the dotted lines\n   in Figure 1. Alice \"calls\" Bob using his SIP identity, a type of Uniform Resource\n   Identifier (URI) called a SIP URI. SIP URIs are defined in Section\n   19.1. It has a similar form to an email address, typically\n   containing a username and a host name. In this case, it is\n   sip:bob@biloxi.com, where biloxi.com is the domain of Bob\u2019s SIP\n   service provider. Alice has a SIP URI of sip:alice@atlanta.com.", "559": "Usually the user will suggest the To\n   header field through a human interface, perhaps inputting the URI\n   manually or selecting it from some sort of address book. Frequently,\n   the user will not enter a complete URI, but rather a string of digits\n   or letters (for example, \"bob\"). It is at the discretion of the UA\n   to choose how to interpret this input. Using the string to form the\n   user part of a SIP URI implies that the UA wishes the name to be\n   resolved in the domain to the right-hand side (RHS) of the at-sign in\n   the SIP URI (for instance, sip:bob@example.com). Using the string to\n   form the user part of a SIPS URI implies that the UA wishes to\n   communicate securely, and that the name is to be resolved in the\n   domain to the RHS of the at-sign. The RHS will frequently be the\n   home domain of the requestor, which allows for the home domain to\n   process the outgoing request.", "560": "This is useful for features like\n   \"speed dial\" that require interpretation of the user part in the home\n   domain. The tel URL may be used when the UA does not wish to specify\n   the domain that should interpret a telephone number that has been\n   input by the user. Rather, each domain through which the request\n   passes would be given that opportunity. As an example, a user in an\n   airport might log in and send requests through an outbound proxy in\n   the airport. If they enter \"411\" (this is the phone number for local\n   directory assistance in the United States), that needs to be\n   interpreted and processed by the outbound proxy in the airport, not\n   the user\u2019s home domain. In this case, tel:411 would be the right\n   choice. A request outside of a dialog MUST NOT contain a To tag; the tag in\n   the To field of a request identifies the peer of the dialog. Since\n   no dialog is established, no tag is present. For further information on the To header field, see Section 20.39.", "561": "The following is an example of a valid To header field:\n      To: Carol <sip:carol@chicago.com>\n8.1.1.3 From\n   The From header field indicates the logical identity of the initiator\n   of the request, possibly the user\u2019s address-of-record. Like the To\n   header field, it contains a URI and optionally a display name. It is\n   used by SIP elements to determine which processing rules to apply to\n   a request (for example, automatic call rejection). As such, it is\n   very important that the From URI not contain IP addresses or the FQDN\n   of the host on which the UA is running, since these are not logical\n   names. The From header field allows for a display name. A UAC SHOULD use\n   the display name \"Anonymous\", along with a syntactically correct, but\n   otherwise meaningless URI (like sip:thisis@anonymous.invalid), if the\n   identity of the client is to remain hidden.", "562": "Usually, the value that populates the From header field in requests\n   generated by a particular UA is pre-provisioned by the user or by the\n   administrators of the user\u2019s local domain. If a particular UA is\n   used by multiple users, it might have switchable profiles that\n   include a URI corresponding to the identity of the profiled user. Recipients of requests can authenticate the originator of a request\n   in order to ascertain that they are who their From header field\n   claims they are (see Section 22 for more on authentication). The From field MUST contain a new \"tag\" parameter, chosen by the UAC. See Section 19.3 for details on choosing a tag. For further information on the From header field, see Section 20.20.", "563": "Examples:\n      From: \"Bob\" <sips:bob@biloxi.com> ;tag=a48s\n      From: sip:+12125551212@phone2net.com;tag=887s\n      From: Anonymous <sip:c8oqz84zk7z@privacy.org>;tag=hyh8\n8.1.1.4 Call-ID\n   The Call-ID header field acts as a unique identifier to group\n   together a series of messages. It MUST be the same for all requests\n   and responses sent by either UA in a dialog. It SHOULD be the same\n   in each registration from a UA. In a new request created by a UAC outside of any dialog, the Call-ID\n   header field MUST be selected by the UAC as a globally unique\n   identifier over space and time unless overridden by method-specific\n   behavior. All SIP UAs must have a means to guarantee that the Call-\n   ID header fields they produce will not be inadvertently generated by\n   any other UA.", "564": "Note that when requests are retried after certain    failure responses that solicit an amendment to a request (for\n   example, a challenge for authentication), these retried requests are\n   not considered new requests, and therefore do not need new Call-ID\n   header fields; see Section 8.1.3.5. Use of cryptographically random identifiers (RFC 1750 [12]) in the\n   generation of Call-IDs is RECOMMENDED. Implementations MAY use the\n   form \"localid@host\". Call-IDs are case-sensitive and are simply\n   compared byte-by-byte. Using cryptographically random identifiers provides some\n      protection against session hijacking and reduces the likelihood of\n      unintentional Call-ID collisions. No provisioning or human interface is required for the selection of\n   the Call-ID header field value for a request. For further information on the Call-ID header field, see Section\n   20.8.", "565": "Example:\n      Call-ID: f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6@foo.bar.com\n8.1.1.5 CSeq\n   The CSeq header field serves as a way to identify and order\n   transactions. It consists of a sequence number and a method. The\n   method MUST match that of the request. For non-REGISTER requests\n   outside of a dialog, the sequence number value is arbitrary. The\n   sequence number value MUST be expressible as a 32-bit unsigned\n   integer and MUST be less than 2**31. As long as it follows the above\n   guidelines, a client may use any mechanism it would like to select\n   CSeq header field values. Section 12.2.1.1 discusses construction of the CSeq for requests\n   within a dialog. Example:\n      CSeq: 4711 INVITE\n8.1.1.6 Max-Forwards\n   The Max-Forwards header field serves to limit the number of hops a\n   request can transit on the way to its destination. It consists of an\n   integer that is decremented by one at each hop.", "566": "If the Max-Forwards\n   value reaches 0 before the request reaches its destination, it will\n   be rejected with a 483(Too Many Hops) error response. A UAC MUST insert a Max-Forwards header field into each request it\n   originates with a value that SHOULD be 70. This number was chosen to\n   be sufficiently large to guarantee that a request would not be\n   dropped in any SIP network when there were no loops, but not so large\n   as to consume proxy resources when a loop does occur. Lower values\n   should be used with caution and only in networks where topologies are\n   known by the UA. 8.1.1.7 Via\n   The Via header field indicates the transport used for the transaction\n   and identifies the location where the response is to be sent. A Via\n   header field value is added only after the transport that will be\n   used to reach the next hop has been selected (which may involve the\n   usage of the procedures in [4]). When the UAC creates a request, it MUST insert a Via into that\n   request.", "567": "The protocol name and protocol version in the header field\n   MUST be SIP and 2.0, respectively. The Via header field value MUST\n   contain a branch parameter. This parameter is used to identify the\n   transaction created by that request. This parameter is used by both\n   the client and the server. The branch parameter value MUST be unique across space and time for\n   all requests sent by the UA. The exceptions to this rule are CANCEL\n   and ACK for non-2xx responses. As discussed below, a CANCEL request\n   will have the same value of the branch parameter as the request it\n   cancels. As discussed in Section 17.1.1.3, an ACK for a non-2xx\n   response will also have the same branch ID as the INVITE whose\n   response it acknowledges. The uniqueness property of the branch ID parameter, to facilitate\n      its use as a transaction ID, was not part of RFC 2543. The branch ID inserted by an element compliant with this\n   specification MUST always begin with the characters \"z9hG4bK\".", "568": "These\n   7 characters are used as a magic cookie (7 is deemed sufficient to\n   ensure that an older RFC 2543 implementation would not pick such a\n   value), so that servers receiving the request can determine that the\n   branch ID was constructed in the fashion described by this    specification (that is, globally unique). Beyond this requirement,\n   the precise format of the branch token is implementation-defined. The Via header maddr, ttl, and sent-by components will be set when\n   the request is processed by the transport layer (Section 18). Via processing for proxies is described in Section 16.6 Item 8 and\n   Section 16.7 Item 3. 8.1.1.8 Contact\n   The Contact header field provides a SIP or SIPS URI that can be used\n   to contact that specific instance of the UA for subsequent requests. The Contact header field MUST be present and contain exactly one SIP\n   or SIPS URI in any request that can result in the establishment of a\n   dialog.", "569": "Alice might have typed in Bob\u2019s URI or perhaps clicked on a hyperlink\n   or an entry in an address book. SIP also provides a secure URI,\n   called a SIPS URI. An example would be sips:bob@biloxi.com. A call\n   made to a SIPS URI guarantees that secure, encrypted transport\n   (namely TLS) is used to carry all SIP messages from the caller to the\n   domain of the callee. From there, the request is sent securely to\n   the callee, but with security mechanisms that depend on the policy of\n   the domain of the callee. SIP is based on an HTTP-like request/response transaction model. Each transaction consists of a request that invokes a particular\n   method, or function, on the server and at least one response. In\n   this example, the transaction begins with Alice\u2019s softphone sending\n   an INVITE request addressed to Bob\u2019s SIP URI. INVITE is an example\n   of a SIP method that specifies the action that the requestor (Alice)\n   wants the server (Bob) to take.", "570": "For the methods defined in this specification, that includes\n   only the INVITE request. For these requests, the scope of the\n   Contact is global. That is, the Contact header field value contains\n   the URI at which the UA would like to receive requests, and this URI\n   MUST be valid even if used in subsequent requests outside of any\n   dialogs. If the Request-URI or top Route header field value contains a SIPS\n   URI, the Contact header field MUST contain a SIPS URI as well. For further information on the Contact header field, see Section\n   20.10. 8.1.1.9 Supported and Require\n   If the UAC supports extensions to SIP that can be applied by the\n   server to the response, the UAC SHOULD include a Supported header\n   field in the request listing the option tags (Section 19.2) for those\n   extensions.

Extensions defined by experimental and\n   informational RFCs are explicitly excluded from usage with the\n   Supported header field in a request, since they too are often used to\n   document vendor-defined extensions. If the UAC wishes to insist that a UAS understand an extension that\n   the UAC will apply to the request in order to process the request, it\n   MUST insert a Require header field into the request listing the\n   option tag for that extension. If the UAC wishes to apply an\n   extension to the request and insist that any proxies that are    traversed understand that extension, it MUST insert a Proxy-Require\n   header field into the request listing the option tag for that\n   extension.", "572": "As with the Supported header field, the option tags in the Require\n   and Proxy-Require header fields MUST only refer to extensions defined\n   in standards-track RFCs. 8.1.1.10 Additional Message Components\n   After a new request has been created, and the header fields described\n   above have been properly constructed, any additional optional header\n   fields are added, as are any header fields specific to the method. SIP requests MAY contain a MIME-encoded message-body. Regardless of\n   the type of body that a request contains, certain header fields must\n   be formulated to characterize the contents of the body. For further\n   information on these header fields, see Sections 20.11 through 20.15. 8.1.2 Sending the Request\n   The destination for the request is then computed. Unless there is\n   local policy specifying otherwise, the destination MUST be determined\n   by applying the DNS procedures described in [4] as follows.", "573": "If the\n   first element in the route set indicated a strict router (resulting\n   in forming the request as described in Section 12.2.1.1), the\n   procedures MUST be applied to the Request-URI of the request. Otherwise, the procedures are applied to the first Route header field\n   value in the request (if one exists), or to the request\u2019s Request-URI\n   if there is no Route header field present. These procedures yield an\n   ordered set of address, port, and transports to attempt. Independent\n   of which URI is used as input to the procedures of [4], if the\n   Request-URI specifies a SIPS resource, the UAC MUST follow the\n   procedures of [4] as if the input URI were a SIPS URI. Local policy MAY specify an alternate set of destinations to attempt. If the Request-URI contains a SIPS URI, any alternate destinations\n   MUST be contacted with TLS. Beyond that, there are no restrictions\n   on the alternate destinations if the request contains no Route header\n   field.", "574": "This provides a simple alternative to a pre-existing route\n   set as a way to specify an outbound proxy. However, that approach\n   for configuring an outbound proxy is NOT RECOMMENDED; a pre-existing\n   route set with a single URI SHOULD be used instead. If the request\n   contains a Route header field, the request SHOULD be sent to the\n   locations derived from its topmost value, but MAY be sent to any\n   server that the UA is certain will honor the Route and Request-URI\n   policies specified in this document (as opposed to those in RFC\n   2543). In particular, a UAC configured with an outbound proxy SHOULD    attempt to send the request to the location indicated in the first\n   Route header field value instead of adopting the policy of sending\n   all messages to the outbound proxy. This ensures that outbound proxies that do not add Record-Route\n      header field values will drop out of the path of subsequent\n      requests.", "575": "It allows endpoints that cannot resolve the first Route\n      URI to delegate that task to an outbound proxy. The UAC SHOULD follow the procedures defined in [4] for stateful\n   elements, trying each address until a server is contacted. Each try\n   constitutes a new transaction, and therefore each carries a different\n   topmost Via header field value with a new branch parameter. Furthermore, the transport value in the Via header field is set to\n   whatever transport was determined for the target server. 8.1.3 Processing Responses\n   Responses are first processed by the transport layer and then passed\n   up to the transaction layer. The transaction layer performs its\n   processing and then passes the response up to the TU. The majority\n   of response processing in the TU is method specific. However, there\n   are some general behaviors independent of the method.", "576": "8.1.3.1 Transaction Layer Errors\n   In some cases, the response returned by the transaction layer will\n   not be a SIP message, but rather a transaction layer error. When a\n   timeout error is received from the transaction layer, it MUST be\n   treated as if a 408 (Request Timeout) status code has been received. If a fatal transport error is reported by the transport layer\n   (generally, due to fatal ICMP errors in UDP or connection failures in\n   TCP), the condition MUST be treated as a 503 (Service Unavailable)\n   status code. 8.1.3.2 Unrecognized Responses\n   A UAC MUST treat any final response it does not recognize as being\n   equivalent to the x00 response code of that class, and MUST be able\n   to process the x00 response code for all classes. For example, if a\n   UAC receives an unrecognized response code of 431, it can safely\n   assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat the\n   response as if it had received a 400 (Bad Request) response code.", "577": "A\n   UAC MUST treat any provisional response different than 100 that it\n   does not recognize as 183 (Session Progress). A UAC MUST be able to\n   process 100 and 183 responses. 8.1.3.3 Vias\n   If more than one Via header field value is present in a response, the\n   UAC SHOULD discard the message. The presence of additional Via header field values that precede\n      the originator of the request suggests that the message was\n      misrouted or possibly corrupted. 8.1.3.4 Processing 3xx Responses\n   Upon receipt of a redirection response (for example, a 301 response\n   status code), clients SHOULD use the URI(s) in the Contact header\n   field to formulate one or more new requests based on the redirected\n   request. This process is similar to that of a proxy recursing on a\n   3xx class response as detailed in Sections 16.5 and 16.6. A client\n   starts with an initial target set containing exactly one URI, the\n   Request-URI of the original request.", "578": "If a client wishes to formulate\n   new requests based on a 3xx class response to that request, it places\n   the URIs to try into the target set. Subject to the restrictions in\n   this specification, a client can choose which Contact URIs it places\n   into the target set. As with proxy recursion, a client processing\n   3xx class responses MUST NOT add any given URI to the target set more\n   than once. If the original request had a SIPS URI in the Request-\n   URI, the client MAY choose to recurse to a non-SIPS URI, but SHOULD\n   inform the user of the redirection to an insecure URI. Any new request may receive 3xx responses themselves containing\n      the original URI as a contact. Two locations can be configured to\n      redirect to each other. Placing any given URI in the target set\n      only once prevents infinite redirection loops. As the target set grows, the client MAY generate new requests to the\n   URIs in any order.", "579": "A common mechanism is to order the set by the \"q\"\n   parameter value from the Contact header field value. Requests to the\n   URIs MAY be generated serially or in parallel. One approach is to\n   process groups of decreasing q-values serially and process the URIs\n   in each q-value group in parallel. Another is to perform only serial\n   processing in decreasing q-value order, arbitrarily choosing between\n   contacts of equal q-value. If contacting an address in the list results in a failure, as defined\n   in the next paragraph, the element moves to the next address in the\n   list, until the list is exhausted. If the list is exhausted, then\n   the request has failed. Failures SHOULD be detected through failure response codes (codes\n   greater than 399); for network errors the client transaction will\n   report any transport layer failures to the transaction user.", "580": "The INVITE request contains a number\n   of header fields. Header fields are named attributes that provide\n   additional information about a message. The ones present in an\n   INVITE include a unique identifier for the call, the destination\n   address, Alice\u2019s address, and information about the type of session\n   that Alice wishes to establish with Bob. The INVITE (message F1 in\n   Figure 1) might look like this:\n                     atlanta.com  . . . biloxi.com\n                 . proxy              proxy     . . .

When a failure for a particular contact address is received, the\n   client SHOULD try the next contact address. This will involve\n   creating a new client transaction to deliver a new request. In order to create a request based on a contact address in a 3xx\n   response, a UAC MUST copy the entire URI from the target set into the\n   Request-URI, except for the \"method-param\" and \"header\" URI\n   parameters (see Section 19.1.1 for a definition of these parameters).

If the header\n   field does not accept multiple values, the value in the original\n   redirected request MAY be overwritten by the header field value\n   communicated in the contact address. For example, if a contact\n   address is returned with the following value:\n      sip:user@host?Subject=foo&Call-Info=<http://www.foo.com>\n   Then any Subject header field in the original redirected request is\n   overwritten, but the HTTP URL is merely appended to any existing\n   Call-Info header field values.", "583": "It is RECOMMENDED that the UAC reuse the same To, From, and Call-ID\n   used in the original redirected request, but the UAC MAY also choose\n   to update the Call-ID header field value for new requests, for\n   example. Finally, once the new request has been constructed, it is sent using\n   a new client transaction, and therefore MUST have a new branch ID in\n   the top Via field as discussed in Section 8.1.1.7. In all other respects, requests sent upon receipt of a redirect\n   response SHOULD re-use the header fields and bodies of the original\n   request.

If a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) response is received (Section\n   21.4.11), the request contained a body that was longer than the UAS\n   was willing to accept.

Section 12 gives guidance on how a UAS can tell whether a request is\n   inside or outside of a dialog. Note that request processing is atomic. If a request is accepted,\n   all state changes associated with it MUST be performed. If it is\n   rejected, all state changes MUST NOT be performed. UASs SHOULD process the requests in the order of the steps that\n   follow in this section (that is, starting with authentication, then\n   inspecting the method, the header fields, and so on throughout the\n   remainder of this section). 8.2.1 Method Inspection\n   Once a request is authenticated (or authentication is skipped), the\n   UAS MUST inspect the method of the request.", "587": "If the UAS recognizes\n   but does not support the method of a request, it MUST generate a 405\n   (Method Not Allowed) response. Procedures for generating responses\n   are described in Section 8.2.6. The UAS MUST also add an Allow\n   header field to the 405 (Method Not Allowed) response. The Allow\n   header field MUST list the set of methods supported by the UAS\n   generating the message. The Allow header field is presented in\n   Section 20.5. If the method is one supported by the server, processing continues. 8.2.2 Header Inspection\n   If a UAS does not understand a header field in a request (that is,\n   the header field is not defined in this specification or in any\n   supported extension), the server MUST ignore that header field and\n   continue processing the message.

The original\n   recipient may or may not be the UAS processing the request, due to\n   call forwarding or other proxy operations. A UAS MAY apply any\n   policy it wishes to determine whether to accept requests when the To    header field is not the identity of the UAS. However, it is\n   RECOMMENDED that a UAS accept requests even if they do not recognize\n   the URI scheme (for example, a tel: URI) in the To header field, or\n   if the To header field does not address a known or current user of\n   this UAS. If, on the other hand, the UAS decides to reject the\n   request, it SHOULD generate a response with a 403 (Forbidden) status\n   code and pass it to the server transaction for transmission. However, the Request-URI identifies the UAS that is to process the\n   request.", "589": "If the Request-URI uses a scheme not supported by the UAS,\n   it SHOULD reject the request with a 416 (Unsupported URI Scheme)\n   response. If the Request-URI does not identify an address that the\n   UAS is willing to accept requests for, it SHOULD reject the request\n   with a 404 (Not Found) response. Typically, a UA that uses the\n   REGISTER method to bind its address-of-record to a specific contact\n   address will see requests whose Request-URI equals that contact\n   address. Other potential sources of received Request-URIs include\n   the Contact header fields of requests and responses sent by the UA\n   that establish or refresh dialogs. 8.2.2.2 Merged Requests\n   If the request has no tag in the To header field, the UAS core MUST\n   check the request against ongoing transactions.", "590": "If the From tag,\n   Call-ID, and CSeq exactly match those associated with an ongoing\n   transaction, but the request does not match that transaction (based\n   on the matching rules in Section 17.2.3), the UAS core SHOULD\n   generate a 482 (Loop Detected) response and pass it to the server\n   transaction. The same request has arrived at the UAS more than once, following\n      different paths, most likely due to forking. The UAS processes\n      the first such request received and responds with a 482 (Loop\n      Detected) to the rest of them. 8.2.2.3 Require\n   Assuming the UAS decides that it is the proper element to process the\n   request, it examines the Require header field, if present. The Require header field is used by a UAC to tell a UAS about SIP\n   extensions that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to\n   process the request properly. Its format is described in Section\n   20.32."}
